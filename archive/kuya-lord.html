<h1 id="kuya-lord">Kuya Lord</h1>
<p>My first attempt at Kuya Lord came on Thursday. Stir crazy, I
resolved to hit the streets and find a place to work. I set out for Kuya
Lord, thinking the small space couldn&#x2019;t possibly hold anything other
than a coffee shop.</p>
<p>I arrived ready to set my laptop up to find a double whammy:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It was closed (hours are 11-3 &amp; 5-9)</li>
<li>It was not a coffee shop</li>
</ol>
<p>My chagrin turned to excitement when I saw what <a
href="https://kuyalord.com/">Kuya Lord</a> was: a Filipino Restaurant.
So close by as well! I&#x2019;ve driven by Historic Filipinotown and I imagined
I&#x2019;d need to make a dedicated excursion to try my hand at Filipino
food.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, a friend wanted to try out Kuya Lord (and even knew one
of the chefs). So on Friday we took to the road for the short walk over.
First, the vibe is if a cafe and a surf shop had a baby. Cozy, tropical,
and crowded. The music is loud, good and nostalgic (at least for folks
my age).</p>
<p>Tables crowd the floor space, filling it to the brim. Inside is like
the shotgun ranches of Indiana, long and narrow. One of my favorite
touches of any restaurant is an open kitchen. In Kuya Lord, you can see
well what is going into your meal. I&#x2019;m not sure why, but I love that
feeling. I suppose it reminds me more of a home than a restaurant, a
small comfort in a big city.</p>
<p>Ordering is simple, which I found reassuring. The menu is manageable,
but the clear choice in my eyes was the platter. You could split it two
ways for a non bank breaking price ($43). I would liken it to a greatest
hits album. You get the highlights, from a delicious noodle dish (Chami)
in peanut sauce (with fresh cabbage on top) to yellow rice spiced just
right. Alongside you get a pickled salad (achara) that delights and
their house vinegar, which goes with everything. I&#x2019;m a sucker for pork
belly, so for the meat we went with Lucenachon.</p>
<p>I was ready for the pork belly, which did not disappoint. I was not
ready for the skin, crispy like I&#x2019;ve never tried. I love it, 10 out of
10 would recommend.</p>

<p>Side note: this is my first time writing food so please excuse the
cheesy lines. I&#x2019;ll learn. Finally was Honey Calamansi juice, which met
my criteria for a favorite drink: changing flavors. Licorice tea is the
primary example here. The &#x201C;front&#x201D; of it is bitter and earthy. The ending
though, is a sweetness that teases and rises. I cannot get enough. Honey
Calamansi juice is a little journey from sour to softly sweet with a
hint of bitterness. I could not get enough and thankfully they serve
huge glasses of it. All in all, I&#x2019;m suitably impressed. I will be back
here, hopefully armed with a better understanding of Filipino cuisine
and Tagalog. I&#x2019;m attempting to learn it and struggling mightily.
Duolingo let me down (again) so I&#x2019;m using Drops, a beautiful (if not
effective) way to learn languages. So far I&#x2019;m rudimentary, limited to
dog (aso), aklat (book), and little else.</p>

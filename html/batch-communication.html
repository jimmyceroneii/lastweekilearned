	<h1 id="why-i-batch-my-communication">Why I Batch My Communication</h1>
	<p>Before I start in earnest here, I want to acknowledge that my
		strategy is far from perfect and a work in progress. It is not fool
		proof, in that some messages require instant communication. With those
		caveats out of the way, here&#x2019;s what I do.</p>
	<p>For almost all of my communication, I use the Getting Things Done
		method of clearing the inbox once a week. The system is supposed to be
		setup for to dos and tasks, but I&#x2019;ve coopted it for my various forms of
		communication. The idea is that you evaluate things all at once on a set
		cadence rather than constantly responding to what comes through your
		door (or ignoring half of it). You capture everything and sort it
		later.</p>
	<p>Why do I do this? I find texting and communication in general to be
		taxing. I&#x2019;m a severe introvert wearing an extrovert&#x2019;s clothes. My
		curiosity and active mind pull me out into the world more than my
		sensitive soul can handle. Further, I&#x2019;m easily distractible and
		sensitive to interruption. If I don&#x2019;t manage my communications
		carefully, I end up frazzled and tired all week long.</p>
	<p>A wrinkle here is that I love to communicate. In the right amount, I
		find it stimulating for the mind and soul. I love my friends and I love
		meeting new people. So I needed a system that allowed me to keep in
		touch consistently without wearing myself out.</p>
	<p>All right I&#x2019;ve beat around the bush long enough. My system is simple.
		Once a week on the weekend (usually Saturday or Sunday), I process all
		the communications of the week.</p>
	<p>If a text is not urgent, I leave it unread. All emails (outside of
		same week scheduling) are saved for later. Whatsapp, Marco Polo and
		anything else get the same treatment. I store them all up.</p>
	<p>One important note is communicating this system with others. When I
		meet someone for the first time, I let them know what I do so that my
		delays are expected and clear.</p>
	<p>Then on the weekend, I sit down at my laptop and crank through them
		all. Everything I can possibly do on my computer, I do on my computer. I
		am a fast typer (80 wpm) and it makes a huge difference. When I&#x2019;m
		replying to 50+ messages from the week, it&#x2019;s the little things like that
		which make a huge difference.</p>
	<p>So far, the system works. It&#x2019;s tiring to do everything in one day.
		But it means I can communicate with more people than I might otherwise
		without interrupting my focus and draining my energy throughout the
		week.</p>
	<p>The biggest hook so far is deciding which messages require instant
		responses. I do find myself drained throughout the week seeing messages
		build up. My stress builds with them. My first attempt at solving this
		has been to clear my notifications so they don&#x2019;t build up.</p>
	<p>My next attempt will be hiding my phone during the work day. I check
		it too often, waiting for messages I won&#x2019;t respond to. If hiding my
		phone doesn&#x2019;t work, I might try checking my messages twice a week
		(Wednesday and Weekend). We shall see!</p>

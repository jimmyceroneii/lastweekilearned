		of Places</h1>
	<p>A few months ago, I spent a month traveling the country. While pit
		stopped at each spot, I tried to evaluate them. In the long winded audio
		notes I recorded, intended to be podcasts, I developed 2 sets of 3
		categories for places.</p>
	<h4 id="the-first-set">The First Set</h4>
	<p>The first set is related to how people relate to a place. When in a
		place, most people do one of three things:</p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Take</li>
		<li>Give</li>
		<li>Go</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Some places are there for people to take from. Mostly we call these
		tourist places, but not all tourist traps are takers. Going further, not
		all places fit neatly into one category. Hollywood in LA is taker city
		but where I live, just south, I&#x2019;d say most people give and engage.</p>
	<p>Other places people give to. I felt like Flagstaff fit this well.
		Folks settle in there, even with the weird give take and go relationship
		that is a major university (Northern Arizona University). My give
		detector is spunky places. You don&#x2019;t find a Kava bar just anywhere.
		Someone opens that to share with their community something they found
		helpful. Side note, Grand Rapids also has a Kava bar and I would call it
		a giving place. So maybe giving is all about Kava bars?</p>
	<p>Finally, you&#x2019;ve got go places. My friend Neil lives in Gallup and
		everyone that can go, does. Now just because a go place pushes people
		away from a city, doesn&#x2019;t mean they actually leave. Listen to Stick
		Season by Noah Kahan for a deep dive on go places.</p>
	<h4 id="the-second-set">The Second Set</h4>
	<p>If the first set is about people&#x2019;s orientation towards a place, the
		second set is all about timing. How long do you want to stay in a place?
		While the first set is not objective, it&#x2019;s got this second set beat by a
		mile. The timing question is almost purely individual.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;ve got three rough categories for timing:</p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>1 week</li>
		<li>2-5 years</li>
		<li>10+ years</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The question here is, which category would you choose for a place?
		You can choose multiple, but I find the results useful every time. And I
		guess that&#x2019;s what I like about these 2 sets of categories. They aren&#x2019;t
		accurate or objective, but they are useful.</p>
	<p>It was the timing question that helped me realize while I loved Santa
		Fe, I would only ever be there for a week at a time. It&#x2019;s too expensive
		for 10+ years and not quite big enough to be interesting for 2-5 years
		(given the cost). Flagstaff on the other hand, is living in that 2-5
		year zone. It&#x2019;s not quite fun enough to make a week worth it, in
		comparison to somewhere like Costa Rica, but there is enough there to
		keep me going for 2-5 years given the cost of living.</p>
	<p>Los Angeles is an interesting one for me. If it weren&#x2019;t for cost, it
		would be a clear yes on all 3 time horizons. Los Angeles is an example
		of another idea I&#x2019;ll probably write about. Sometimes observing your
		behavior is the best way to understand your feelings and make a
		decision.</p>
	<p>I said I was going to leave Los Angeles many times. I even looked for
		apartments. But I&#x2019;m still here. We decide with our feet more than our
		minds.</p>

Movie</h1>
<p>Last weekend I broke the seal on the Barbie movie and watched it not
once, but twice. Since then, I&#x2019;ve been trying to make sense of it and
come up with an original take. Talking with a friend last night, I
finally found that take.</p>
<p>My focus in reflecting on Barbie is adjacent to the main stars.
Barbie and Ken are fascinating in their own right and much ink is
spilled about them. My focus is on an under-appreciated, yet significant
role played by Will Ferrell.</p>
<p>Thanks to Scott Galloway, Liz Plank, and many others, my interest in
creating a healthier masculinity is growing day by day. Ken presents an
interesting set of commentary on modern masculinity, but it&#x2019;s Will
Ferrell&#x2019;s role that I find more compelling.</p>
<p>Ken&#x2019;s role begins pathetic, shifts to dangerous, and comes back to
enlightened. there&#x2019;s real power to naming that arc and exposing it. The
entitlement, insecurity, and obsessions of men are worth investigating
and healing. Ken is full of the hard edges that make this story
recognizable and problematic.</p>
<p>Will Ferrell&#x2019;s character is a different animal. He is portrayed as
childish, yet powerful. Kara Swisher talks about our culture&#x2019;s
simultaneous deification and coddling of men like this. Silicon Valley
is full of men who deny their power, hiding behind the adult&#x2019;s in the
room.</p>
<p>Ken&#x2019;s trop is more obvious and it&#x2019;s easier to see danger there. The
Andrew Tate&#x2019;s of the world are a real threat. But as Lil Wayne says,
real g&#x2019;s move in silence. The covert nature of the Will Ferrell&#x2019;s of the
world means their impact is underestimated.</p>
<p>To my mind, that makes them the more dangerous and difficult group.
Treating a disease no one believes in is an impossible task. The pattern
that I see here is the denial of power. It is a paradox, as it is
strange to assert that those who deny power can be as dangerous as those
who grasp it.</p>
<p>Yet when we think about the movie as a whole, we start to realize
that it is Will Ferrell&#x2019;s character who creates all the problems. Ken is
a symptom. The decisions made by a powerful CEO who denies his own power
are pulling the strings all along.</p>
<p>There are tongue in cheek references to this throughout, but I missed
it on the first watch through. I locked in on the primary story lines,
missing the background bass that drove the movie.</p>
<p>The CEO&#x2019;s abdication of his power and his simultaneous exercise of it
to maintain his position is a sleight of hand trick worth applause. We
miss the real culprit as he hides beneath his childish ways.</p>
<p>Moving away from the Barbie movie, we are seeing this play out live
with Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Two powerful men who pretend to be
victims at various times. Zuckerberg is clever enough to pair himself
with Elon to look favorable. Yet there is no denying he uses many of the
same tactics as Elon.</p>
<p>They both mastered the art of appearing less powerful than they are.
Zuckerberg&#x2019;s golden era of the trick came during the Cambridge Analytics
scandal. He did not know what was going on. His ignorance continues as
folks like Jonathan Haidt point out the nefarious impact of Instagram on
our children. Zuckerberg is conveniently naive, stuck on the &#x201C;power of
connection&#x201D; and the metaverse.</p>
<p>Musk, as much as I dislike him, is playing the game at another level.
He is able to project contradictory images. First, he&#x2019;s a genius playing
3D chess while others play checkers. Second, he&#x2019;s a man child reposting
baseless conspiracy theories. The holding of these two identities in
tension is as difficult to manage as it is intentional.</p>
<p>Those who could hold Elon accountable view him as a child, dumb but
harmless. Those who can empower him view his genius. Through sleight of
hand he appears more powerful to his allies and less threatening to his
enemies. It is a frightening playbook to run.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s effective and the Barbie movie lays it out for us. What do we do
here? Kara Swisher is right when she says we need to keep in mind these
are adults with real power. Just because they act childish, does not
mean they are not to be held accountable.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is a father, a CEO, and over 50. It&#x2019;s time he started
acting his age. He is not a victim, he is an actor, in all sense of the
word. Watching a man roller skate into Barbie world is funny. Watching a
man holding the keys to a war joke about cage matches is not.</p>

	<p>In proposing this slightly odd question, I am conscious of the need

		both with respect to its general function within discourse and in my own
		writings; that is, this question permits me to return to certain aspects
		of my own work which now appear ill-advised and misleading.</p>

	<p>As an aside, I find this idea fascinating because it&#x2019;s a sort of

<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Democracy in America - Neil and I finally kicked the can with this
		one. Our take? The book is ahead of its time, but not particularly
		novel. We realized so many of its ideas are quietly embedded in our
		thoughts about government. It&#x2019;s worth reading to recognize its cultural
		relevance, but for novel concepts I&#x2019;d recommend Why We Are Polarized by
		Ezra Klein.</li>
	<li>No More Mr.&#xA0;Nice Guy - I still don&#x2019;t like the title, but the ideas
		are growing on me. Adam Lane Smith is the first person who helped me
		recognize needs are not gifts, but burdens and opportunities for
		connection. This book is helping me take the steps I need to live that
		idea out.</li>
	<li>Your Money or Your Life - One of my close friends lives life on her
		terms. From the outside, I imagine her values align with her life quite
		well. Mine needs some adjusting and I&#x2019;m so thankful to my friend Kevin
		for recommending this book. A much needed recalibration!</li>

<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-we-are-what-we-dream-of">Idea of the Week: We
	are what we dream of</h2>
<p>One of my best friends stunned me with a thought experiment
	yesterday. He laid out a scenario where we controlled our dreams. We
	could make them whatever we wanted. At first, we&#x2019;d likely fulfill all of
	our greatest fantasies. We&#x2019;d gorge on hedonism, only to find with the
	endless time our dreams provided, they felt empty. We&#x2019;d then move to
	higher pursuits, chasing consistency and meaning.</p>
<p>I thought the experiment would end there. But my friend then made the
	same point Esther Perelle does in Mating in Captivity: we would grow
	bored. Even with all our &#x201C;true&#x201D; needs met, we would find ourselves
	drowning in predictability. What we&#x2019;d turn to after all our dreams years
	of bliss is randomness.</p>
<p>We don&#x2019;t really want all our dreams, both shallow and deep, to come
	true. We don&#x2019;t want to know the outcome. We don&#x2019;t actually want control,
	even as we fight tooth and nail for it.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s the thought experiment. I&#x2019;m not sure what to make of it, to be
	honest. I don&#x2019;t take enough time to dream, let alone imagine my dreams
	and those beyond them coming true. But this experiment contains the
	familiar weight of truth.</p>
<p>And do be honest, it exposes most of my machinations as folly. One of
	the central tenants of No More Mr.&#xA0;Nice Guy is that the smooth life is
	an illusion. There is no amount of &#x201C;right&#x201D; we can do to get it problem
	free. What blows my mind though, is that the problem free life is not
	truly desirable. We crave uncertainty, adventure, discovery. Knowing it
	all is no fun.</p>
<p>This little thought experiment has me thinking. What can I let go of?
	What bit of control I feel keeps me safe is in fact the very thing
	holding me back?</p>

World&#x2019;s Oldest Ultramarathon Runner Is Racing against Death</a> - I&#x2019;m a
former distance runner. I still get tingles down my spine reading
stories like this. Running is the ultimate fight against self and to see
someone in the ring this late is nothing short of inspiring.</li>

<p>Time stalks everyone, but when it catches up with a professional
athlete, it can be brutal to watch. It&#x2019;s why so many of the greatest
names in sport often fade from the spotlight once they leave the field,
to age out of sight.</p>

Search of Virgil Abloh</a> - One of my favorite artists, Burna Boy,
references Virgil Abloh often. After one of my many <a

time to learn about Abloh. The more I learn, the more I&#x2019;m impressed.
He&#x2019;s nothing short of a polymath with the echoes of his life
reverberating across the world.</li>

he meant by utopia is &#x2018;something is missing,&#x2019; as he would say. I always
had the feeling that he was also interested in producing and making
things happen that were missing.&#x201D;</p>

Korea Nuclear Overview</a> - It is easy to clown North Korea, but I&#x2019;m
unconvinced it is wise to do so. As an American, my default posture to
countries like North Korea is an arrogant skepticism. I&#x2019;m working to
replace my cockiness with curios wariness and this article is a step in
the right direction.</li>

<p>North Korea (aka the Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea or DPRK)

Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to pursue a nuclear weapons

Programming Language Odyssey</a> - I love a technical article with life

article. There&#x2019;s nothing worse than dry writing. I might give technical
writing a shot after reading this. Yet more inspiration from this
week!</li>

<p>Eli produced an interesting tale of his programming language odyssey
today where he tried to recreate his programming language journey. I
found it highly entertaining to read precisely because it&#x2019;s
personal&#x2014;and, for a change, even though the word &#x201C;programming&#x201D; in the
title seems to emit some technicality, it is distinctively not a
technical article.</p>

<h2 id="media-im-consuming">Media I&#x2019;m Consuming</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;m hoping to make this a little more free flowing. I&#x2019;m recognizing
that more and more, the content I consume is far more diverse than just
books. I&#x2019;m watching more TV and movies, using some of the same
strategies I used to read more books. I watch multiple things at a time
and I quit anything I don&#x2019;t love. As a result, I watch more than I do
before and get way more out of it.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s a little sampler of the media I&#x2019;m consuming this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dark (German Stranger Things)</li>
<li>New Amsterdam (Touching Version of Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy)</li>
<li>Babel (Around the World in 20 Languages)</li>
<li>Korean Script Hacking (Lightning Fast Literacy)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the language learning front, I&#x2019;m loving the Script Hacking Book
series. Once I wrap up the Korean Script, I&#x2019;ll be moving on to Hindi or
Arabic. I will be learning scripts separate from the language in the
hopes that I can remember the script when it comes time to learn how to
speak a language. In the meantime, I&#x2019;ll be picking up languages based on
how easy they are to learn and practice. For now, that&#x2019;s Italian the
language of my ancestors and a few friends. I&#x2019;ll start learning that in
earnest soon using Duolingo.</p>
<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-the-asymmetry-of-kindness">Idea of the Week:
The Asymmetry of Kindness</h2>
<p>Kindness, like a stock option, is asymmetric. I&#x2019;m still teasing out
what this means. I started thinking about the concept while reading <a
href="https://moretothat.com/a-letter-to-my-newborn-daughter/">A Letter
to My Newborn Daughter</a>. In it, the author defines kindness as, &#x201C;the
ability to trade personal gain for mutual trust.&#x201D; The definition of a
fuzzy concept like kindness got me thinking, &#x201C;What are the properties of
kindness?&#x201D;</p>
<h3 id="kindness-is-asymmetric">Kindness is Asymmetric</h3>
<p>To demonstrate that kindness is asymmetric, I&#x2019;m going to start by
imagining it wasn&#x2019;t. What if life only gave what it got? What if, like
in the <a href="https://lastweekilearned.com/the-good-place.html">Good
Place</a>, there was a score? In this scenario, there are no random acts
of kindness. Such a thing is unimaginable in a world of symmetric
kindness. In a world of symmetric kindness, we would see more trades
than relationships.</p>
<p>While my claim in general is that kindness is asymmetric, we do know
symmetric kindness when we see it. Symmetric kindness is rampant in the
City of Angels, where everyone is in &#x201C;the business.&#x201D; Networking at its
worst is a form of symmetric kindness. I give you this and you give me
that.</p>
<p>Yet at its best and most authentic, kindness is asymmetric. I first
learned about asymmetry as a concept while reading the Black Swan by
Nassim Taleb. Today I want to apply the concept to kindness.</p>
<p>The way the author frames kindness leads me to think of it as an
asymmetric investment. The most asymmetric of all investments is
insurance. You pay a little now in exchange for protection from a Black
Swan.</p>
<p>Kindness is insurance. You trade a little bit of your time and
thought for the option to redeem goodwill later. The trade of kindness
is what builds trust. Once I used that framing, the rest clicked into
place. Kindness is asymmetric. You can invest a little kindness someone
once and it can return dividends for the rest of your time here.</p>
<h3 id="kindness-is-cheap">Kindness is Cheap</h3>
<p>Unlike other investments though, kindness is not necessarily costly.
Investing in startups and the like often requires a certain activation
energy ($200k worth). Kindness, like running, requires little equipment.
You can be kind anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no corporation controls kindness. There is no charge for
it. At it&#x2019;s simplest, kindness costs a little time and a little thought.
That&#x2019;s all.</p>
<h2 id="the-kindness-strategy">The Kindness Strategy</h2>
<p>If kindness is cheap and asymmetric, the best strategy is to get
after it. Spread the kindness around. All you stand to lose is time. And
who knows what you stand to gain.</p>

	<h1 id="writing-again">Writing Again</h1>
	<p>It&#x2019;s been a few years since I&#x2019;ve written as much as I have in the
		last month. The last few years, excepting a 90 day stretch I&#x2019;ll get to
		in a moment, felt like a drip from a spigot left on during a cold
		winter. The words would careen their way through aching pipes, plopping
		out in big, random globs.</p>
	<p>Now it feels like a summer day where someone left the hose on. The
		words just keep flowing. It&#x2019;s funny how when you get in the habit of
		writing, you write more than you mean to. I only ask myself to write <a href="https://750words.com/">750 words a
			day</a>.</p>
	<p>Back when I wrote less, every word felt like a chore. Now that I
		write more, I often write 750 only to come back later in the day for
		more. I felt the same way about exercise as a kid. I ran and swam and
		biked like a maniac. Then on my own time, I&#x2019;d go back for seconds.</p>
	<p>The last time I wrote this much, I needed a financial incentive.
		Using <a href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>, I set it up such
		that every day I didn&#x2019;t write, I automatically sent my brother $5.
		Thanks to my cheapness and brotherly rivalry, I kept that streak up for
		90 days. I remember coming home from friend&#x2019;s houses buzzed and pounding
		out my article for the day half alive at 3 am. I committed. Funny what
		$5 will do.</p>
	<p>While <a href="https://medium.com/jimmys-ten-cents/how-i-write-everyday-even-though-im-lazy-80e3c0ab1a66">that
			streak was successful</a>, it <a
			href="https://medium.com/jimmys-ten-cents/why-i-failed-to-write-daily-for-years-45b9f190cb8c">wasn&#x2019;t
			joyful or sustainable</a>. It&#x2019;s funny to read about my prior
		experiments. The first thing I notice is that I <a
			href="https://world.hey.com/jimmy.cerone/improving-my-outputs-6ebb6e1a">write
			about my writing</a> an <a
			href="https://medium.com/jimmys-ten-cents/the-compounding-interest-of-good-habits-8ac098f5d641">unhealthy
			amount</a>. I even question <a href="https://medium.com/storymaker/on-a-writer-eda34f5c1b2e">whether I
			am a writer</a>, though after 250 articles I think that question is
		finally settled. The second thing I notice is what I got wrong.</p>
	<p>At various points I&#x2019;ve claimed to crack the code of writing daily.
		I&#x2019;m not foolish enough to say I&#x2019;ve done it now after so many articles
		claiming I&#x2019;ve done so. But I know what I got wrong.</p>
	<h4 id="publishing-schedule">Publishing Schedule</h4>
	<p>Neither publishing at a set time daily nor publishing at a random
		time works. At the moment, I do a weird hybrid of the two and it works.
		I write at lunch on the weekdays and in the morning on the weekends. I
		publish one newsletter a week plus whatever else happens to spill out.
		It&#x2019;s a strange mix of structured and loose.</p>
	<h4 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h4>
	<p>I tried every writing tech stack out there, many of them multiple
		times. 200 words a day I tried more than once, Obsidian I gave a good
		long shot. I&#x2019;ve never tried Apple Notes (maybe I should?). Craft came
		and went, only to seemingly stay. Once again though, I use a weird
		hybrid system here. Almost all of my drafts start their life in 750
		words, dropping into Craft for publishing and because it just feels so
		nice to write in.</p>
	<h4 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h4>
	<p>I&#x2019;m not sure what other factors contribute to this stretch of writing
		success. The shift to my own website certainly contributes. It&#x2019;s nice to
		have a place of my own without any statistics. I obsess over statistics
		of any kind, optimizing like a maniac. The calm of publishing and
		knowing no one will ever read my thoughts it&#x2019;s surprising for an
		attention grabber like me.</p>
	<p>The question left in my mind at the moment is, &#x201C;Will this last? How
		long?&#x201D; Me, being the worrier I am, already considered whether this
		streak will stand the test of children (probably not) or travel
		(probably yes).</p>
	<p>I wish I could say I&#x2019;ve found the formula for writing often. I
		thought I did many times before. All I know for sure is something I
		wrote a few years ago now: &#x201C;my best days involve writing.&#x201D;</p>

	<h1>Hyper Local</h1>
	<p>
		I write to remember. I've had a terrible memory as long as I can remember, not helped by multiple severe
		concussions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Right now, I write about what I read, to lock it in and connect it. More and more though, I'm yearning to expand my
		topics. I want to remember what food I like, the places I go, and more. My first foray into this expansion is a
		hyperlocal blog, where I write short blurbs about the places around me.

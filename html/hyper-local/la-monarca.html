	<p>La Monarca is about a mile away from my apartment. It takes a while
		on foot, being past even the Smart &amp; Final. That said, I always
		overestimate how far Smart &amp; Final is because my memories of it
		involve carrying groceries, making the walk seem interminable.</p>
	<p>It sits at the intersection of two huge streets, the first real hub
		near me to the North. To the South is Koreatown, where the streets pulse
		with people. Near me is quiet and unassuming. Of course past La Monarca
		things get busy, with the legendary Hollywood Boulevard looming in the
		background and the 101&#x2019;s thrum even closer.</p>
	<p>Santa Monica and Western, two huge streets, cross in front of La
		Monarca. On the corners of these monsters are whole markets that appear
		in the morning and disappear late at night. People sell seemingly
		everything here, from strange supplements to Rambutan, a lovely fruit
		that&#x2019;s hard to find.</p>
	<p>The hubbub both attracts and repels me. In many ways, I find it
		intimidating. There was nothing like this in my small Indiana hometown.
		There still isn&#x2019;t, even as the town grew to almost 100,000 residents.
		Yet the adventurer in me finds it electrifying. I love the constant
		change. Since the barrier to entry is so low, vendors come and go,
		swapping endlessly.</p>
	<p>Enough about the surroundings, La Monarca inside is a comforting
		presence. Here, coffee shops are hit or miss. Some are little more than
		a coffee take out place, with little to no seating. Others are
		cavernous, spilling across rooms and the boundaries of inside and
		outside.</p>
	<p>La Monarca is all indoors, but it&#x2019;s spacious and full of charm.
		Beautiful, sturdy wood tables cover the faux wood floors. Tempting baked
		goods line the left entryway, calling to you as you try to walk out with
		only a coffee.</p>
	<p>An interesting feature of La Monarca is they sell coffee beans. In
		Grand Rapids, this is nothing new. Almost every shop either roasts their
		own or sells a local brand. Here in LA, the focus seems to be less on
		the coffee and more on the drinks. Grand Rapids wants for creations like
		Matchata (Matcha &amp; Horchata w/coffee) but makes up for it with pure
		coffee.</p>
	<p>La Monarca is the first place I&#x2019;ve seen selling beans themselves
		(though I didn&#x2019;t look hard before). My friend Will sold me on the idea
		of grinding my own beans and while I lack both a grinder and beans, I&#x2019;m
		on the hunt. It looks like La Monarca might be the first place I buy,
		once I scrounge up a grinder.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;ve yet to try the baked goods, even as they call my name softly
		from their spot across the store. But the coffee is phenomenal. I wanted
		to try the wild combination of the Matchata, but they were out. So
		instead I settled for what looked to be the default: cafe de olla.</p>
	<p>I assumed it would be the same boring black coffee I get everywhere.
		My mind was blown by what I found. Cafe de Olla is more than coffee.
		It&#x2019;s coffee with cinnamon, cardamom, anise and more steeped in. It
		almost tastes like tea and coffee had a baby. There&#x2019;s much more on the
		menu that defies my mental categories of coffee (cafe oaxaca being chief
		among them).</p>
	<p>I will be back to report on my thoughts of these soon. For now, I&#x2019;m
		impressed La Monarca. Thank you.</p>

	<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>No More Mr.&#xA0;Nice Guy by Dr.&#xA0;Robert Glover - Again the title is bad,
			but the content is solid. There are parts I disagree with (do &#x201C;man
			things&#x201D; like fishing, for example), but on the whole I&#x2019;ve found this
			helpful. More and more I&#x2019;m realizing the magic of knowing and
			communicating your needs. Sounds obvious, but for someone like me it&#x2019;s a
			game changer.</li>
		<li>Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller - I first found out about
			adult attachment theory when I read The Science of Happily Ever After by
			Ty Tashiro. From there I moved to Hold Me Tight by Sue Johnson. It&#x2019;s
			funny I read this one last, as it&#x2019;s the most comprehensive and helpful
			of the 3. For folks with an anxious attachment style like me, it&#x2019;s a
			godsend.</li>
		<li>Conscious Uncoupling by Katherine Woodward Thomas - This is the most
			helpful guide I&#x2019;ve come across for navigating a breakup. I wish I&#x2019;d read
			it before my breakup - it would have saved me from many mistakes. Even
			if you aren&#x2019;t in a relationship, this is worth a read to get a hold of
			the thoughtful ideas it contains about uncoupling.</li>
		<li>Democracy in America - I&#x2019;m still stuck here. Other books are taking
			priority. I bought a hard copy of it in hopes of kick starting my
			reading.</li>

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-running-faster-doesnt-work">Idea of the Week:
		Running faster doesn&#x2019;t work</h2>
	<p>Back when I ran competitively, a terrible habit held me back. I would
		blast out of the gates like a hare. Then when I inevitably fell apart
		towards the end, those smart ass tortoises would reel me in.</p>
	<p>For years, I kept trying some variation of this tortoise and hare
		technique. As I got faster, it seemed to work better. I could fly out of
		the gates and build up more and more of a lead. Yet at a certain point,
		my talent ran out on me. There&#x2019;s just no way anyone can survive a dead
		sprint for a 5k.</p>
	<p>After years of my coach telling me to try a new tact, an injury
		forced me to do so. I blew out my leg and lost more than a year to it.
		When I came back, I came back ready to try something new.</p>
	<p>The results were immediate. Weeks after returning, I won my first
		ever race (a junior varsity one, but still). What was the secret?
		Leaving some extra in the tank.</p>
	<p>I became the tortoise instead of the hare. The change scared me. I
		felt nervous loitering around for the first half of the race, worried I
		wouldn&#x2019;t be able to hit the gas when I needed to. Over time though, I
		came to trust I had it in me.</p>
	<p>While sprinting out of the gates felt like giving it my all, the
		reality was that approach didn&#x2019;t hold space for the potential I held.
		Starting slower and running a smart race demonstrated trust in my
		ability. Flying out of the gates really meant running away from me. It
		meant running away from responsibility.</p>
	<p>It looked great, but it worked badly. As I process a recent breakup,
		I&#x2019;m realizing I spent most of the relationship trying to run faster. I
		worked harder, doubled down on what I thought &#x201C;worked.&#x201D;</p>
	<p>Yet in doing so, I failed to consider alternative approaches. I took
		the easy route in many ways, just as I had back in my running days. When
		we give more effort for the same results, the answer is not more effort.
		The answer is to change your approach.</p>
	<p>What are you doubling down on now? Is it giving double the
		results?</p>

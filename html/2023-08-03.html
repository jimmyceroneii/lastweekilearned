	<p><a href="https://web.getmatter.com/entry/3851005">The HTML Review</a>
		- An exciting collection of HTML only websites that demonstrate the
		power of the basics I referenced in my <a href="https://oaklang.org/posts/oak-perf-jan-2022/">blurb on Oak</a>. I
		love to see small scale back to basics movements like this. The
		accessibility of them makes seeing them empowering because the result is
		in reach.</p>
	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-always-have-a-back-up-plan">Idea of the Week:
		Always have a back up plan</h2>
	<p>I do not ask what could go wrong with enough frequency. Thinking
		about what could go wrong (aka anxiety) is not the same as asking the
		question. When we worry about the future, we are dissociated to some
		degree. Our mind is not firing on all cylinders.</p>
	<p>The more I learn about psychology, the more I learn about physiology.
		The body and mind are connected, which sounds obvious. Yet the
		implications of this connection are varied and misunderstood. Our body
		is a complex system with dependencies we cannot begin to imagine.</p>
	<p>What I find interesting is I&#x2019;ve spent my whole life worrying my way
		out of problems. Yet worrying through things is a dissociative process
		that disconnects us from our bodies. Worry roots us in the ancient
		amygdala which thinks in simple, black and white terms.</p>
	<p>When we panic, life becomes simple. We run, freeze, or fight. That
		simple is good in so many situations, even necessary. Yet when thinking
		about future events, it is not helpful. Worrying about a scenario leads
		to simplistic solutions to complicated problems.</p>
	<p>The same skill that serves us when we must react hinders us when time
		is on our side. Explicitly asking the question, &#x201C;What could go wrong?&#x201D;
		is a profound shift. At least that is my theory.</p>
	<p>My theory is rooted in practice, but is not well proved out yet. I
		spent the last few weeks working through a huge project at work. I
		worried like crazy, funneling my nervous energy into action. In the end,
		my worry failed me.</p>
	<p>It&#x2019;s not a guarantee, but had my rational mind been more in the
		driver&#x2019;s site, I might have caught my mistake. My hope is that by asking
		the question instead of dancing around it, I can prevent problems going
		forward.</p>
	<p>I can shift my energy from passive worry dissipated through movement
		to thoughtful inquiry that leads to real solutions. What are these
		solutions? I think the most effective term is backup plans. What happens
		when things go wrong?</p>
	<p>I love Nassim Taleb&#x2019;s Black Swan and I think that book is
		fundamentally about this question. How do you plan for the catastrophic?
		I am tired of letting this question simmer in the background for days on
		end. I want to move it to the forefront.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;m not sure how to operationalize it yet. But I&#x2019;m working on it. I
		have thoughts in a couple of areas of life. I carry multiple debit cards
		as backups. My phone is setup with Apple Pay even though I never use it.
		Lots of backups.</p>
	<p>Backups seem excessive. But god are they lifesavers when you need
		them. The definition of asymmetry right there. Growing up my dad loved
		backups and I didn&#x2019;t understand it. He had not one, but 2 computers full
		of downloaded (not streamed) music. He had a hotspot on his phone plus
		cell service on all his iPads.</p>
	<p>Most DJs don&#x2019;t think of that stuff. It&#x2019;s these little details, all
		the backups, that separate my dad from the pack. He&#x2019;s more than just a
		DJ, he&#x2019;s a host.</p>
	<p>I suppose that&#x2019;s my north star for now. What would a good host do?
		How would a good host prepare for the worst? It&#x2019;s weird to adopt that
		mentality at work or in life, but it just might be the difference
		between disaster and inconvenience.</p>
	<p>My last point here is a hopeful one. I think focusing on backup plans
		can worm us out of the most consequential debates of our time. Living
		out West, I think of the climate often. I&#x2019;m sad we are mired in debates
		about an important issue framed unhelpfully by both sides.</p>
	<p>I propose backups as a way out. Thinking about the climate from a
		national security perspective is simple and clear. What if we lose one
		of our major pipelines, like Germany did at the start of the War on
		Ukraine? Renewables can be deployed in a distributed, local first
		manner. You ever see oil done in that way? Unless you live on an oil
		field, it&#x2019;s not possible. Renewable energy (as Puerto Rico is
		demonstrating) provides an excellent backup plan.</p>
	<p>If we can&#x2019;t agree on whether to go &#x201C;all in&#x201D; on renewables, I believe
		we can at least agree on the strategic value of deploying local first
		renewables as a backup plan.</p>

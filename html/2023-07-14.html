		<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/netflixs-new-chapter/">Netflix&#x2019;s New
				Chapter</a> - I am nursing a growing obsession with Netflix. First,
			their offices out here are just stunning. Anyone that can make an office
			building beautiful is onto something. Second, the sheer odds they
			competed against are mind blowing. Finally, their tech is just so
			beautiful and well done. This article only increased by
			fanboy-ness.</li>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Carl Icahn, though, who owned a major chunk of Blockbuster and had
			long feuded with Antioco, finally convinced him to resign that very same
			quarter; Antioco&#x2019;s replacement took money away from Total Access and
			funneled it back to the stores, and Netflix escaped (Hastings would
			later tell Shane Evangelist, the head of Blockbuster Online, that
			Blockbuster had Netflix in checkmate). Blockbuster went bankrupt two
			years later.</p>

				a simple tag helped India save fuel worth $8.4 billion</a> - We need
			more innovation like this across the world. Simple, efficient, and game
			changing. I want less block chains and more traffic tags. Let&#x2019;s make it
			happen folks.</li>
	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		<p>India made FASTag mandatory for vehicles in February 2021. The tech
			seamlessly transfers the toll fee from the vehicle owner&#x2019;s registered
			e-wallet &#x2014; such as their Paytm wallet &#x2014; to the National Highways
			Authority of India (NHAI).</p>

		<li><a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/">Craft</a> - I found this
			article so damn inspiring. In a world dominated by speed and efficiency,
			it&#x2019;s easy to forget beauty and well-done-ness. Like a good angel, this
			article is sitting on my shoulder this week, pushing me to make my work
			just that much more thoughtful.</li>

		<p>Quality products can take your users from &#x201C;I&#x2019;m merely using this

		<li><a href="https://web.getmatter.com/entry/32378798">Thread again</a>
			- I&#x2019;m thankful to Tim Ferriss for introducing me to this blog - it&#x2019;s so
			clear and thoughtful. Here is the best take on social media I&#x2019;ve ever
			seen. Only new networks win. Social media does not age well. It sounds
			simple but this principle is so profound.</li>
	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		<p>It&#x2019;s simply the youngest of all the major social networks. I&#x2019;ve
			always believed that social media&#x2019;s biggest bug is one that has yet to
			be acknowledged or addressed by TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram or
			Twitter: Time. None of these apps age well. The longer we use these
			apps, the more we complain, the less pleasant the experience. Have you
			ever thought about why? It&#x2019;s not just the UI/UX flaws, non-chronological
			feeds, and inability to edit.</p>

		<li><a href="https://getmatter.com/email/27377652/?token=27377652%3A0zfAqOPG9y0Pxa8zjUt2K3QQaJU">People
				got mad at me for my real estate comments</a> - Buying a home is seen as
			one of those few, invariably positive decisions. I&#x2019;ve yet to hear
			someone catch flack for buying their first home. Yet I am afraid we fail
			to ask hard questions about home buying. Remit does here.</li>
	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Here&#x2019;s something to think about: I never want to set my life up so
			ONE FINANCIAL MOVE could ruin me. If 80% of my net worth is in a single
			illiquid property, that would terrify me! What happens if my house gets
			flooded? You see this in real estate a lot, especially developers.
			They&#x2019;ll be making tons of money every year&#x2026;and then suddenly, they&#x2019;re
			bankrupt. Not for me.</p>

	<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Valley of Amazement by Amy Tan - I&#x2019;m stunned by this one. It slipped
			into my top 10 favorite books ever. The build is slow (over 500 pages)
			but it&#x2019;s worth it. A well balanced meal, this thing stands the test of
			the long read with grace and beauty (and plenty of tragedy).</li>
		<li>The Secret History by Donna Tartt - Man is this one an exciting
			read. There&#x2019;s breadcrumbs everywhere. I cannot wait to find out what
			goes down.</li>
		<li>F*ck Love by Michael and Sarah Bennett - There is an unfortunate
			amount of stereotypes strewn throughout this and it&#x2019;s not even sniffing
			at inclusivity. That said, it reminds me of Remit&#x2019;s writing about home
			buying. I am guilty of getting rose colored glasses in love and this is
			setting me straight. The best way to get a great relationship is to
			avoid a bad one.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-none">Idea of the Week: None</h2>
	<p>I am bowing out of idea of the week this week. I wrote one draft
		about boundaries, found it derivative, and tried a few other ideas, none
		of which stuck. I did publish something of an idea this week, which I
		will share here: <a href="https://lastweekilearned.com/batch-communication.html">Why I Batch
			My Communication</a>.</p>
	<p>But it didn&#x2019;t feel like <em>the</em> idea of the week. It felt like
		<em>an</em> idea. The article on Craft got me thinking about quality. I
		write this blog for fun, but I want it to be good. The right mix then,
		is to keep writing daily and when something good comes along, publish
		it. But I&#x2019;m not going to force it if I don&#x2019;t find it.
	</p>
	<p>So no idea of the week. Enjoy less to read and have a wonderful week
		of learning!</p>

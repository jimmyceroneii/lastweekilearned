			those not in tech, skim this as an exercise in breaking down complex

				Importance of Learning CSS by Josh Comeau</a> - Ok this one is written

			We all need a <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/12/12/shallow-dives-professional-development/">shallow
				dive</a> on CSS as it runs so much of the internet we see. CSS is a web
			primitive that unlocks new worlds. Check it out.</li>

				Japan&#x2019;s Hope by Walter James</a> - There&#x2019;s plenty of reasons to find
			this article interesting. One is the changing status of Japan in the
			technology landscape. While still a world leader, I still struggle to
			grasp what Japan represented to the world in the heyday of companies
			like Honda. Another is Perovskite in general. I&#x2019;m more and more obsessed
			with solar and I might zoom in on Perovskite based on what I learned
			here. As a plug, you should dig into the publication behind the article,
			Power Japan. Fascinating stuff.</li>

	<ol type="1">
		<li>Babel by Gaston Dorren - I will be buying this book. In fact I&#x2019;m
			pausing my writing to do so now. Ok I&#x2019;m back. I am so impressed by the
			sheer amount and variety of info contained here. One of my favorite
			tidbits so far is the sheer number of loan words from Arabic. Plus the
			structure of that language is mind blowing. It moved up on my &#x201C;to learn&#x201D;
			list.</li>
		<li>A War of Witches by Timothy Knab - Still no idea what to think of
			this one. My one take away so far is a deeper consideration of my
			dreams. I would love to start dream journaling so if anyone has tips,
			send them my way.</li>

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-wants-and-needs">Idea of the Week: Wants and
		Needs</h2>
	<p>I am a closet Drake listener. As someone who loves to be unique and
		stand out, I find it embarrassing to say I love Drake. The words barely
		make their way out of my mouth for the shame. I <em>did it</em> (bumped
		Drake in the car) the other day and felt the cringe deep in my
		bones.</p>
	<p>One of Drake&#x2019;s songs inspired my idea of the week, Wants and Needs.
		So here I am owning my love of Drake out in the world. I suppose now
		that I&#x2019;m committing this to paper, I could have avoided the reference to
		the title. But here we are.</p>
	<p>Why Wants and Needs this week? I think it&#x2019;s hard to acknowledge, but
		for some of us our wants and needs are scary. Why would someone fear
		what they want and need? On the surface, it makes zero sense.</p>
	<p>And if I&#x2019;m honest, I would never consciously admit to the habit of
		concealing wants and needs. It&#x2019;s not something I try to do, but it is
		something that happens. The only way I&#x2019;ve found to reveal it is to ask
		myself directly what I want and need. For those of us who make our
		living meeting the needs of others, this question is a foreign one.</p>
	<p>I only came across it when listening to I Will Teach You to Be Rich.
		On the podcast, Ramit Sethi lambasts men who, when asked what they want,
		say, &#x201C;Whatever makes my family happy.&#x201D; The first time I heard him come
		after someone for saying that, it shocked me. What else could you want
		other than the happiness of others?</p>
	<p>When Ramit prodded these men for their own wants and needs, they
		stumbled. I stumbled along with them. For months now, I&#x2019;ve worked to
		discover what kind of life I want to live, on my own terms. What does my
		rich life look like?</p>
	<p>The picture is still fuzzy, if I&#x2019;m honest. I&#x2019;m just scratching the
		surface and running experiments to figure out what I love, what lights
		me up. When I look back and think about my cluelessness on this, it
		strikes me as odd.</p>
	<p>Thank goodness it does. I may not have the answers now, but I know
		that to know others but not yourself is a dangerous thing. I now see my
		old way of being as driving a car with no owner&#x2019;s manual. Earlier in
		life, I didn&#x2019;t know what kind of oil kept me running best, what octane
		of gas I required, or how to detect issues.</p>
	<p>We know what it takes to keep a car in working order. We would do
		well to pay more attention to our own bodies and what makes them
		run.</p>
	<h2 id="song-of-the-newsletter">Song of the Newsletter</h2>
	<p>I picked up what is an annoying habit for my neighbors. I now write
		with a single song on repeat. I don&#x2019;t need to worry about skipping
		songs, I just pick one and go. I&#x2019;m adding the song I write an article to
		into all my writing from here on it. This week it was Cloud by Surfaces,
		a strange band I love. I did not grow tired of it over 30 minutes of
		writing so that&#x2019;s a stamp of approval from me.</p>

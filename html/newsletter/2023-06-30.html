				have loved biology</a> - I relate on a deep level here. I grew up
			devouring every book on animals I could find. I spent hours outside,
			watching the natural world like a young scientist would, mimicking my
			hero Steve Irwin. Then came school and biology fell to the wayside,
			victim to more interactive subjects like math or Chemistry. As this
			article points out, it didn&#x2019;t have to be this way. How many biologists
			do we lose every year to rote memorization?</li>

		<p>How do you develop a physical understanding of biology? I like
			pictures. One of my favorite books is called The Machinery of Life, by
			David Goodsell. It&#x2019;s full of gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations.</p>

				the Medicine to the White Man</a> - My relationship with Native America
			is a complex one. I grew up as many white Americans did, believing a
			Native American grandmother sat somewhere on my family tree. A DNA test
			proved this wrong but my fascination stuck around. In college, I read
			all I could about Native America, sifting through a history few of us
			are taught. Yet interest is not always clearly benign. I love the tough
			eyed look this article takes at the line between appreciation and
			appropriation. A difficult read, but a worthy one.</li>

			&#x201C;Gentle Eagle.&#x201D; Linda, who was seventy-five years old, and white, was
			sitting cross-legged on a cot. She was short and strong, with a leathery
			tan and extraordinarily thick, long hair&#x2014;brown except for two streaks of
			white framing her face like curtains.</p>

			- Software, like biology, often feels cold and analytical. The Browser
			Company is taking a different tact. I love how they bring fun and
			humanity back into software, both in their blog and their incredible web
			browser, Arc. This is the kind of internet and tech I think we need more
			of. Less rockets to Mars and more delightful web portals please.</li>

	<blockquote>
		<p>A space that&#x2019;s a bit softer, with less hard edges where software
			doesn&#x2019;t even have to feel like software. It can be fun. It can be
			playful. Both for what it is and what it lets you do. So much so that we
			can make ourselves feel at home in it.</p>

				Software is My Copilot, Who Programmed My Software?</a> - LLMs are black
			boxes to the nth degree. What&#x2019;s funny about them is they are less black
			boxes than endless boxes. Even if I could see all that OpenAI trained
			on, I&#x2019;d never get through it all. So far, I&#x2019;ve succumbed to the
			complexity and left the origins of the tech alone. This article forced
			me to think harder about what&#x2019;s going on behind the curtain.</li>

	<blockquote>
		<p>While activists might quibble about minor details to optimize
			imagined utopia, this thought experiment shows computer-assisted
			software authorship does not inherently negate software freedom. Rather,
			the rules, requirements, and policies that apply will determine whether
			software freedom is respected.</p>

		<p>The more generally important part of this, I think, is the move to
			add interface, control and product to the prompt: instead of typing 50
			words into a box and waiting to see what you get, there are options and

			think these kinds of features, like most automation and indeed like
			Photoshop, will produce more employment, not less: making these kinds of

	<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>The Secret History by Donna Tartt - Not only does her name remind me
			of Jamie Tart, she writes a damn good book. I loved the Goldfinch and
			I&#x2019;m already hooked on this one a chapter in.</li>
		<li>The Valley of Amazement by Amy Tan - Continuing my trend of reading
			famous authors non-famous books. I love this one so far. It&#x2019;s
			emotionally cutting without being depressing, a difficult but human
			combo.</li>
		<li>The Pale King by David Foster Wallace - Wallace runs circles around
			my mediocre mind so far. I&#x2019;m intrigued but confused. Also notable is the
			fact I&#x2019;m reading 3 <em>fiction</em> books for the first time in my
			recent memory. Woohoo.</li>

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-gardening-for-life">Idea of the Week: Gardening
		for life</h2>
	<p>Gardening is boring work. You set it up, maintain it, and then wait.
		Most of the time, what you do seems to make no impact at all. The
		saying, &#x201C;Watching grass grow,&#x201D; is an analogy with teeth for a
		reason.</p>
	<p>Not that I don&#x2019;t try to see. I&#x2019;m growing lemon balm on my balcony and
		I check it with great expectation each day. Some days I imagine I see
		growth, but on honest days I can&#x2019;t tell the difference. Only when I
		remember the seeds I threw in last month do I see the miraculous
		growth.</p>
	<p>Day by day, I notice nothing. Glacial change makes gardening soul
		sapping work. But the nice thing about gardening is it is realistic
		work. It is work that mirrors reality. Sometimes, when I play too much
		Pokemon, I expect the world to mirror games. Speedy, linear growth I can
		control.</p>
	<p>Real life is more like a garden. Haphazard, unexplainable, and
		uncontrollable. What grew last year might not grow this year. Rain or
		frost may destroy a season of hard work. Birds may steal your harvest
		and bugs may sicken it. Gardening reminds us that we are guests on the
		earth, with less control than we imagine.</p>
	<p>Yet even so, we shape the world around us in a million tiny ways that
		add up. When we water our plants and bring them into the shade, our
		actions send ripples. Roots take their places, leaves prepare to emerge.
		Fruit hides in the flowers, waiting to be coaxed out.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;ve always loved the saying, &#x201C;You can do less in a day than you
		think but more in a month.&#x201D; Lately I&#x2019;ve hit a motivational valley. I&#x2019;m
		doing all the things I&#x2019;ve always wanted, writing daily, going to bed on
		time, learning languages. I&#x2019;m healthy and life feels smooth. But I don&#x2019;t
		yet see the fruit.</p>
	<p>So I&#x2019;m discouraged, even as I&#x2019;m moving towards the life I want, if
		slowly. Gardening is, fundamentally, about lag measures. The visual
		results are delayed by months or even years. The difficulty in
		connecting my effort with the results leaves me wanting.</p>
	<p>I suppose then I write this as a reminder to myself and to you. You
		won&#x2019;t see the fruit for a while. It will be even longer until you taste
		it. But it&#x2019;s growing. Even if you can&#x2019;t see it. So take heart and keep
		watering, weeding, and feeding whatever it is you are growing.</p>

Rucking Challenges</a> - I struggle to work out and so I&#x2019;m always
looking for hacks. This is a perfect example of what my professor called
function stacking, a fancy word for killing two birds with one stone.
The examples here are intense, but the practice is simple. I ruck in the
airport with my heavy bag and I feel way better about it than I have any
right to.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, I know my cardio is solid, and my legs are strong if I
can run up a particularly steep mountain near my house without stopping.
But you might consider rucking a certain distance to ensure you&#x2019;re ready
for a big backpacking trip or vacation.</p>

not well suited to the news cycle for a variety of reasons. I drop this

cycle about the war in Ukraine is fading. The war is no less important

Conviction, Elon Musk</a> - The key quote in this article is the use of
taste over A/B tests. A/B testing is great for local optimizations. But
to create step changes in an industry, you cannot use A/B testing. A
true act of creation is so generative it defies A/B testing. I&#x2019;m curious
about the edges of this idea, but I am already using it to start to
imagine startups in a different way.</li>

<p>I&#x2019;m thinking about how A/B tests are a kind of mental laziness. You
can&#x2019;t A/B test your way into building Tesla. And I&#x2019;m thinking about
Linear (a product I love and use every day), whose founder recently said
they rely on taste and opinions to make decisions.</p>

mobile web apps are slow</a> - I am indulging myself again. But I will
argue my case nonetheless. Mobile phones are such a marvel we sometimes
forget their limitations and the sheer amount of innovation that goes
into dodging them. Plus, this article is out of date (2013) and it gives
much needed context into just how far we&#x2019;ve come in 10 short years.</li>

<p>It&#x2019;s a remarkably efficient architecture as far as CPU time goes, but
it achieves that performance essentially at the cost of gobbling as much
memory as possible. iOS is not architected to be low-memory&#x2013;it&#x2019;s
optimized to be fast.</p>

<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-when-inspiration-strikes">Idea of the Week:
When Inspiration Strikes</h2>
<p>This week I&#x2019;m listening to <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4wM44uqkqW77hfaptjitUM?si=EHdfMSuEQjmkA-Cg4geJXA">Morgan
Housel on the Tim Ferriss show</a>. Housel is a writer and investor
whose blogs and books impress me. In the podcast, Ferriss and Housel
talk shop about writing. There are two insights I&#x2019;m keen to tease out
here.</p>
<p>First, Housel stops everything when inspiration strikes. Cal Newport
talks about Adam Grant doing the same. Grant, when inspiration strikes,
skips meetings and turns everyone away from his door. I&#x2019;m beginning to
wonder if my strategy is a mistake. When inspiration strikes, I make a
note of the idea and move on. The bad part? I almost never get to the
idea again. It languishes in my &#x201C;Writing Ideas&#x201D; reminders list, never to
be seen again.</p>
<p>To change the visibility of ideas, I&#x2019;m moving from Reminders to
Bullet Journaling. My goal is to review the writing ideas page each
morning before I sit down to write. Maybe that will revive some of these
dormant ideas.</p>
<p>The second interesting point from Ferriss and Housel is writing
should be easy. In their experience, when they write with ease, their
blogs pop off. When they drag the words from their fingers, no one reads
a word. I cannot say this is my experience. I&#x2019;ve written blogs that I
think are crap, dredging each word from the depths, only to find that
others love it. I&#x2019;ve also written like a madman, words flying off my
fingers, only to see that post go nowhere.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m 300 posts deep now so I trust my experience. But these folks are
big dogs, so their thoughts give me pause. I do wonder what my writing
would look like if I cared less about the ideas I came up with in the
past. The efficiency beast in me wants to write down and cross off every
idea I imagine. There&#x2019;s got to be some degree of &#x201C;drag&#x201D; in holding onto
all my ideas. I might experiment with a clearing of the list every
couple of months. A jubilee of sorts to reset my writing debts.</p>
<p>All this to say, inspiration is finite. It is lightning in a bottle.
Thanks to Tim and Morgan, I&#x2019;m going to treat it that way more going
forward. When inspiration strikes, I&#x2019;m going to write, rather than
create a reminder. I&#x2019;m not sure I will cancel all my meetings like Adam
Grant, but maybe one day I will be that bold. In the meantime, happy
creating. May the inspiration gods look upon you fondly.</p>

<p><a
href="https://open.spotify.com/album/51jD9mF5wg2WMBd4xVeYTi?si=0MoOxkz7QtuRAVwJLoPXmg">Amethyst</a></p>
<p>I cannot put my finger on what I love about this EP, but I&#x2019;ve
listened to it an absurd amount in the past two weeks. The song writing
is incredible, even as the sound is a little too pop for my taste. I
recommend listening to her other albums, as the songwriting is
remarkable. Julia probably ghost wrote most of your favorite pop hits.

<p><a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/261598353">Charity
Navigator - Rating for Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund</a></p>
<p>Last week I wrote about the need for our government to reflect the
widespread support for better gun safety in our laws. This week I found
a way to act on it. Even better, this is a two for one deal. Charity
Navigator is a great way to evaluate non profits and offers a convenient
and centralized way to donate. I gave $5 because I tell myself that
every little bit counts.</p>

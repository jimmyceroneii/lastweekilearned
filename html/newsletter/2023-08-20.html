		<li>Anxiously Attached - I started this a few months ago and read a few

			good one.</li>
		<li>Babel - I&#x2019;m a language nerd and before this book I felt myself
			flying blind. I love maps and this feels like a quick guide to world
			languages. I&#x2019;ve learned more about languages reading this than many
			hours on Duolingo taught me.</li>
		<li>The Secret History - The burn on this is slow but worth it. The
			introduction sets the scene in such a smart way. I keep unfolding the
			mystery even as the author uses my expectations to surprise me along the
			way.</li>

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-gratitude-for-the-incomplete">Idea of the Week:
		Gratitude for the Incomplete</h2>
	<p>When a dream you cherish disappears, it&#x2019;s tempting to feel anger. The
		loss of a dream is a type of grief. It is natural to feel anger, but
		it&#x2019;s not safe to stay there forever.</p>
	<p>Often what I find myself doing is moving through anger to
		forgetfulness. For a long time, I thought forgetting it happened was
		enough. I wasn&#x2019;t angry any more, right? That&#x2019;s enough.</p>
	<p>Yet forgetfulness is a form of numbness and like anesthesia, it only
		lasts so long. As Andy Mineo says, &#x201C;If you bury your emotions, you bury
		them alive. They only come back stronger sometime later in your life.&#x201D;
		I&#x2019;m in a period of excavation, digging through the mound of emotions I
		left behind.</p>
	<p>At the same time, I&#x2019;m trying to avoid digging new holes. I&#x2019;m trying
		to learn to hold emotions, even as my fingers itch for a shovel. My
		north star is holding an emotion until I can find gratitude.</p>
	<p>There&#x2019;s a relationship between gratitude and peace. I don&#x2019;t feel
		either enough to know how they work together. But I know whenever I see
		one, the other is not far behind.</p>
	<p>Gratitude though, is hard. I don&#x2019;t know that we think of it that way.
		We often say the word without much thought. Thank you rolls of the
		tongue more times than we can count. When we switch the words around,
		the meaning comes back. To give thanks.</p>
	<p>What does it mean? To give thanks. More and more, I believe there is
		a sacrifice involved. Why sacrifice? I&#x2019;m still not sure. I know it more
		as a feeling than anything else. I suspect it is because all we can give
		is ourselves. There is nothing else we own. To give thanks then requires
		to give of yourself, a sacrifice.</p>
	<p>If we don&#x2019;t give of ourselves, what are we really giving? Giving
		without sacrifice must be a form of manipulation. We are giving from
		someone or something else.</p>
	<h3 id="a-hippie-detour">A Hippie Detour</h3>
	<p>My final unrelated thought here starts with a story. This weekend I
		spent with my dog in the mountains and forests of Arizona. The time with
		him felt like a gift given by the land itself. I felt a welcome and I
		gave thanks. When we recognize a gift, there&#x2019;s no other response.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;m sad that when we talk about the environment, stories like this
		don&#x2019;t come up. I support environmentalism, but I don&#x2019;t find it human
		enough. We speak of doomsday and we omit our thanks. I wonder if we all
		gave more thanks, more would change.</p>
	<p>What if when talking to the skeptical, we started with their stories?
		What might we find if we gave people a chance to talk about the lands
		they love?</p>
	<p>We delude ourselves into imagining all our companies and products
		come from our ingenuity. These are essential ingredients, sure, but at
		the end of the day none of these are ours to give. They come from a
		source which is not our own.</p>
	<p>When we think deeply, we can recognize the gifts of the earth
		everywhere. What might change if we railed less against the horrors of
		capitalism (manifold, yes) and gave thanks for what&#x2019;s been made? We
		can&#x2019;t change the past. We can&#x2019;t remove the plastic. What if we thanked
		it instead?</p>

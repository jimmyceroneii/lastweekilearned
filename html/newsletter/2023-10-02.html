Won&#x2019;t Eat</a> - I love when I read writing that makes me want to think
(or write). I want to create my version of this article. I don&#x2019;t agree
with the author but boy was it fun to read through their thinking.</li>

<p>Second, I&#x2019;ve tried going full vegan. I stopped. I sometimes have
trouble eating enough food, and often a bit of cheese is cheaper and
easier and more tempting than anything else. Hopefully, once I&#x2019;m
better-funded or my tastes change, I&#x2019;ll revisit this compromise and will
be approximately at peace with my diet.</p>

Best Tax System on Earth</a> - An interesting contrast to the article
above. Details a tiny fishing-powered country with an innovative tax
structure. Makes me wonder if we could start to implement such a system
city by city here. The quote here is a teaser: the results of the system
speak for themselves.</li>

<p>The crisis also partly motivated the establishment of a national
bank, the Landsbanki F&#xF8;roya, which handles the issuance of government
debt, monitors financial risks, and maintains a rainy-day investment
portfolio equal to 15 percent of GDP. &#x201C;If there comes a crisis&#x2026; we have
some liquidity to spend and prepare for what to do,&#x201D;</p>

its broad thoughts on technology than the specific ideas about China. I
will be using this a blue print for my own thoughts on the topic. As an

thinker.</li>

Story: The Meteoric Metamorphosis of La Monarca Panader&#xED;a</a> - I&#x2019;m
indebted to La Monarca for introducing me to the delight that is Caf&#xE9; De

<p>All we ever heard was, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t spend a lot of money.&#x2019; Our philosophy
from the beginning was that&#x2019;s just not true, nobody likes cheap stuff.
People like the best they can afford. If I&#x2019;m going to bring you a cake,
I&#x2019;m going to buy you the nicest I can afford for my budget. Why should
Latinos get pegged for that and the rest of the world deserves something
nice?</p>

ask if they&#x2019;re free for a longer tour.</p>

<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Nine Cloud Dream by Kim Man-Jung - I am always surprised when an
old book turns out to be a page-turner. So far the reading experience
reminds me of Jane Eyre. More than many modern books, this one leaves me
wanting more. I&#x2019;m so impressed by the metaphors and symbolism I barely
grasp. A wild book in that it both exceeds my grasp and feels
approachable.</li>
<li>Babel No More by Michael Erard - Still chugging through this one. I
feel like the most shocking parts about the true nature of
hyper-polyglots are behind me. Now it feels like the author is grasping
for straws. Still interesting, but I&#x2019;m fading fast on this one.</li>
<li>How to Not Write Bad by Ben Yagoda - I wish I could absorb this one
better. I&#x2019;m learning lots but I fear I will retain little. Many of these
rules I knew already, but others stumped me. The author recommends
writing without music and phones. I can give up my phone but I&#x2019;m not
sure about my writing music.</li>
<li>The Ruins of Gorlan by John Flanagan - A throwback to my childhood
days, this book is as good as I remember. I find myself on the edge of
my seat even as I know what will happen. I credit Flanagan for many of
my childhood thoughts on creativity and leadership. Great stuff.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-an-argument-against-static-balance">Idea of the
Week: An Argument Against Static Balance</h2>
<p>When I talk about balance, I speak of it as if my life is a pie
chart. To find balance I need to find the magic proportion of activities
per day and week. If I exercise 15% of the time, write 10% and sleep 35%
my life will be in check. I&#x2019;m tired of chasing that theoretical
balance.</p>
<p>Last month I felt out of balance. I socialized like crazy, spending
almost every evening out. The back half of the month found me recovering
from overextending myself. In the past, I would beat myself up about
this lack of &#x201C;balance.&#x201D; The more I look at things, the more I realize
this is balance.</p>
<p>I felt energetic so I went out. Then I felt tired so I stayed in. I&#x2019;m
learning 2 lessons about balance from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balance is a long-term, not a short-term concept</li>
<li>Balance is dynamic</li>
</ul>
<p>Balance depends on so many factors. Fundamentally, it&#x2019;s a qualitative
measure of how well you feel you are handling the various parts of your
life. Those parts change and grow and shrink. Constantly. There is no
&#x201C;formula&#x201D; for balance. If there were, it would be some scary
differential equation with 50 variables.</p>
<p>Further, balance is not measured by the day, the week, or even the
month. Balance is best measured in seasons. I spent a season focused on
a relationship. My life was unbalanced, but for good reason. I was
trying to build something important. My life is now focused on exploring
and my friends, two parts of my life I neglected on purpose.</p>
<p>It is a different season. Each season on its own is unbalanced, but I
can only hope that in the long run, I&#x2019;m hitting all the right notes.
With that analogy, I&#x2019;m thinking of my life as a band with many members.
Not every band member sings the solo on every song. Not every band
member even sings. But if I do my job right, that band cranks out some
great, balanced songs. That&#x2019;s the goal at least. Stay balanced
folks.</p>

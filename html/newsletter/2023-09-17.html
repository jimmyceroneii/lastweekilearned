	<h4 id="lucifer">Lucifer</h4>
	<p>This week I&#x2019;m taking a detour. I&#x2019;ve not read much this week. Instead,
		I spent my night time binge watching the TV show Lucifer. I&#x2019;ll write
		more about this at a later time, but there&#x2019;s one them in the show I want
		to touch on. Actions speaker louder than words. I&#x2019;m good with words and
		I lean on them too often. That is one of the many learnings I will take
		from my previous relationship. In Lucifer, you see someone who sounds
		evil, but acts kind.</p>
	<p>Watching this as someone whose words are kinder than his actions is a
		damning act. I am learning a lot from Lucifer, who rarely lets his left
		hand know what the right is up to. I&#x2019;m surprised to find it endearingly
		admirable.</p>
	<h4 id="dark">Dark</h4>
	<p>As a lover of Stranger Things and foreign languages, I&#x2019;m digging this
		German mystery. It is supernatural without being goofy, smart without
		being too clever. The characters are deep and complex. I cannot ask for
		much more from this show.</p>
	<p>Best of all? It&#x2019;s delightfully paced. I always find myself wanting
		more but I rarely find myself binging the show. It feels more like a
		good meal than fast food. As much as I love Lucifer, that tends in the
		other direction.</p>
	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-meaning-and-play">Idea of the Week: Meaning and
		Play</h2>
	<p>As I&#x2019;m writing on this, I&#x2019;m feeling deja vu. I might have written
		about this before, but here I am again with some degree of an update. As
		long as I can remember, I&#x2019;ve driven myself to exhaustion.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;m writing this to Non Stop from Hamilton and it feels fitting. I
		often feel unaccomplished for 25. When I write down my work, I see how
		funny my faux humility is. In the past 5 years, I&#x2019;ve written almost 300
		articles, recorded over 100 podcasts, 100 YouTube videos, and started 2
		companies. None of these blasted off like I&#x2019;d hope, so I denigrate my
		efforts.</p>
	<p>The effort itself though is stunning. I am a machine. Age is nipping
		on my heels, I can feel it creeping up. Today it&#x2019;s 25, tomorrow it will
		be 30. Someday I hope kids will come. I see my time and focus
		fading.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;m no longer able to push myself like I did in my late teens and
		early twenties. Some of that is the energy refills that used to be built
		into my life. My output floated on a tide of social relationships and
		exercise I took for granted. After school, I let those go and my energy
		went to the wayside.</p>
	<p>What I&#x2019;m recognizing now is that while I don&#x2019;t always see social life
		and exercise as efficient, they are critical. There is an activation
		energy associated with these activities, but they give more than they
		take. Why?</p>
	<p>Because they are play. I look down on play. It&#x2019;s not serious enough
		for me. But a funny thing happens when I allow myself to play
		(basketball, dance, etc). My energy returns. It does not make sense to
		my black and white brain, but play is a critical ingredient to my
		energizer bunny.</p>
	<p>I learned play before meaning. When play started to come into my
		life, I felt the energy return. As my energy came back, it fizzled out
		in a million directions. Without meaning, my energy felt empty.</p>
	<p>Meaning is harder for me to find in part because it&#x2019;s riskier. Play
		is fun. Meaning is vulnerable. To find meaning, I am digging deep into
		what matters to me most. I am terrified by the process.</p>
	<p>Last week, I took a risk to find meaning and made a LinkedIn post
		offering to help up and coming software developers. I felt such imposter
		syndrome with that post, but I fought through it for the sake of
		meaning. What is all my energy for if it&#x2019;s not headed in the right
		direction?</p>
	<p>Today I tried another shot at meaning. I&#x2019;m starting to volunteer as a
		dog walker at a rescue. I cannot describe what dogs mean to me. Growing
		up, my dog was my best friend. In any social situation, I find the dog
		before I talk to the people. Finding this shelter is a godsend for
		me.</p>
	<p>I am slow to identify the return on giving. Play feels like an
		obvious energy gain. Giving and meaning though seem like huge lifts
		which drain. And they can drain you. But so far I&#x2019;m finding meaning is
		yet another battery for this energizer bunny. Stay tuned for my further
		experiments with it.</p>

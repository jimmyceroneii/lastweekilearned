<p>Knock on wood, I&#x2019;m hoping that this is a return to my weekly cadence
for writing this newsletter. Next up is restoring the weekly cadence to
my podcast recording and then finally getting my product reviews up and
going again. Thank you for bearing with me and staying patient!</p>

Nonfiction with Wait Buy Why and David Pernell</a> - A quick and
shameless plug for the Matter Reader here, which allowed me to read the
transcript of this podcast rather than listening to it. I first heard of
Tim Urban via his hilarious Ted Talk, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU">&#x201C;Inside the mind of a
master procrastinator.&#x201D;</a> He is at least as good of a writer as
speaker, which is saying something.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>So when it comes to influencing the world yeah, I think that starting
Netflix documentaries, building a big YouTube channel, those are the
places to go. But when it comes to meeting people and thinking better,
personal blogs are the way to go.</p>

(taylor&#x2019;s version)</a> - First, I love Liz Plank&#x2019;s work. From her
newsletter Airplane Mode to her podcast Synced with Monica Padman, I&#x2019;m a
huge fan. Taylor Swift is mind blowing and proof of her dominance is on
full display here. So many interesting threads to pull on in this
one.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>What happened to male players for a few hours on Sunday, is what
female athletes have had to deal with for decades. Sydney Crosby even
devoted an entire campaign to draw attention to this glaring inequality
in the way reporters address athletes.</p>

Yelp&#x2019;s Core Business Search to Elasticsearch</a> - I&#x2019;m indulging my
software side a little here. I love migrations as they are difficult and
highlight how much tech changes. I&#x2019;m obsessed with search at the moment
and getting a peak underneath the Yelp hood fascinated me.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a large team of developers working constantly on improving
the ranking algorithm for the search results. We end up making code
pushes to the underlying search ranking algorithm multiple times a day
and with the legacy system, each code push took several hours.</p>

Aftermath of a Massacre is Always the Time to Push for Gun
Legislation</a> - I&#x2019;m watching Suits and my head is buzzing with the
word leverage. We saw it in the UAW strike, the 2023 off year elections
and I hope we see it here. We agree on more than we imagine, it is time
our laws reflect the broad support stricter gun control enjoys.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Our emotional responses to these massacres are valid. Strike while
the iron, and our blood, is running hot. Let our emotions fuel the
urgency of our attempts to respond with <a

better for Africa&#x2019;s underserved consumers. They built cameras that
picked up darker skin tones correctly, batteries that lasted longer, and
unique features like multiple SIM slots to suit how Africans were
navigating data costs.</p>

<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
<p>I just started the Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles. My cousin gave me
the book following my breakup and it&#x2019;s a balm to my soul. Complicated
characters dealing with difficult circumstances in graceful ways is
strangely thrilling. Towles gets my hats off, this is a great follow up
to one of my favorites, A Gentleman in Moscow.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m skimming a chunk of books in addition to Lincoln Highway. I&#x2019;m
using my favorite, Switch, to manage a team change at work. Decisive by
the same authors is one I can&#x2019;t wait to start in earnest. I&#x2019;m not a
great decision maker so I can use all the help I can get.</p>
<p>Finally, as a kid I somehow got my hands on the Unthinkable, a book
about surviving disasters. I&#x2019;m reading it now to sharpen my thinking
about incident management at work.</p>
<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-acknowledging-limited-capacity">Idea of the
Week: Acknowledging Limited Capacity</h2>
<p>While visiting my cousin in New York City, she showed me her fitness
ring. Like my Apple Watch, it checks a variety of metrics. My favorite
feature is the recommendations it makes based on your health. If you&#x2019;re
struggling with a cold (high body temperature), it will recommend you
take an easy day. If you slept well and your vitals are strong, it will
recommend a workout.</p>
<p>I make the mistake of imagining all my days are the same. You will
see me white knuckling it through a similar workload regardless of my
health. Just this week, I took a day off to recover from a late night of
travel.</p>
<p>Come morning, groggy as I was, I made my way over to my keyboard,
7:30 sharp. I&#x2019;ve come to believe I made a mistake. I did need a day off.
If I&#x2019;d been wearing my cousins smart ring, it would&#x2019;ve told me so.</p>
<p>My lesson this week is that not all days are created equal. We can
overcome difficult circumstances, like lack of sleep or sickness. But we
cannot do it all the time. Our capacity is finite and variable. What I
could do last week, I may not be able to replicate this week.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m looking forward to a fun, packed week. I did it to myself and I&#x2019;m
struggling to accept my many fun activities will mean I do less than I
want to. I don&#x2019;t have a magic ring to tell me to be gentle, but I&#x2019;m
hoping that by writing these words, I can conjure a little grace for my
future self. I wish the same to you. Remember that we can only work with
what we&#x2019;re given. Let us take rest when we need it and surprise
ourselves when we don&#x2019;t this week.</p>
<h2 id="album-of-the-week">Album of the Week</h2>
<p><a

LOVE CAME TO KILL US+</a></p>
<p>Jessie Reyez was a slow burn for me. Like many of my favorite
artists, she started as a feature for me. I would find her name on
unfamiliar albums and add them to the queue. I did not check out her
actual work until a random afternoon last month.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m now hooked. This album in particular is incredible. It&#x2019;s a
journey from sultry highs to melodic lows. I&#x2019;m so taken with her voice,
song writing and self awareness.</p>
<h2 id="cause-of-the-week">Cause of the Week</h2>
<p><a href="https://haitineedsyou.com/">Home - Haiti Needs You</a></p>
<p>Modern medicine is a marvel and Haiti Needs You brings it to Haiti,
where there is incredible suffering. It&#x2019;s worth digging into <a

history</a>, but their present needs immediate help.</p>

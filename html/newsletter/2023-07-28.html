	<ol type="1">
		<li>Skull Water - The initial fire for this book is fading, even as the
			book heats up. There are a few character switches here I&#x2019;m struggling to
			keep up with. Overall though, the historical perspective of the Korean
			War is priceless. I had no idea how powerful North Korea was at one
			time.</li>
		<li>The Secret History by Donna Tartt - My god is this one getting
			interesting. I am chomping at the bit here. Just the perfect amount of
			suspense and intrigue. Tartt is an expert at keeping you in the dark but
			giving you enough light to wonder.</li>
		<li>Babel - I took a trip to the big library in downtown in LA and came
			away with so many gems. I didn&#x2019;t know what I was missing at my tiny
			library branch. This book takes you around the world in 20 languages in
			a travelogue style. So well written.</li>

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-learning-to-play-the-game">Idea of the Week:
		Learning to Play the Game</h2>
	<p>As Neil knows well, I think of everything in life as a game and an
		experiment. I&#x2019;m constantly trying new strategies and picking up tips
		about everything from dating to cooking.</p>
	<p>For a long time, I struggled to handle my ways. I hyper focus and
		it&#x2019;s disruptive. I would try to live a balanced life, avoiding the
		games. Yet I kept getting drawn back. I remember when I was interested
		in the LinkedIn game. My mind whirred about ways to grow my network and
		expand my reach. I set limits on my time on LinkedIn, wore myself out
		with meetings, and learned to write in the LinkedIn style.</p>
	<p>I went over the top with my efforts. But I learned so much. Today
		LinkedIn is my strongest (and only) platform thanks to the work I put in
		years ago. I&#x2019;m able to use LinkedIn in a thoughtful, measured way.</p>
	<p>I guess what I&#x2019;m curious about is, could I find a thoughtful way to
		use LinkedIn without going bonkers? More and more I don&#x2019;t think that is
		the case. An inconvenient truth about myself is that I dive deep into
		every interest. There is just no halfway for me.</p>
	<p>Instead of trying to manage my hyper focus, my goal is now to accept
		it. I don&#x2019;t mean I will let it run wild, but I will no longer try to
		keep it in a cage. My hyper focus is at once my greatest strength and
		achilles heel. I can learn to use it while still protecting myself from
		it.</p>
	<p>The term I use here is called the third path. So often, I am a man of
		extremes. I&#x2019;m either overusing LinkedIn or deleting my account. These
		extremes though, far from being horrible distractions, are the third
		path. I find my way to balanced usage through experimentation.</p>
	<p>Moving forward I&#x2019;m not even sure I will use the language extremes. I
		want to use the language of experimentation. I try removing LinkedIn
		completely and see how that feels. I try using LinkedIn every day and
		see how that feels. As I try more and more strategies, I end up finding
		a calm third path.</p>
	<p>It is difficult to accept, but there is no shortcut in life. We must
		move forward with mistakes. No amount of thinking or anticipating gives
		us a free pass to the third path. The third path of calm and reason is
		only found through experiments that at times look wild.</p>

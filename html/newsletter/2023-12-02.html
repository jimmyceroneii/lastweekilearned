creating systems to automate that kind of work? What&#x2019;s that for?</p>

<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-facing-the-wrong-direction">Idea of the Week:
Facing the Wrong Direction</h2>
<p>Today I looked for the sunrise and didn&#x2019;t find it. I drove to a
friend&#x2019;s house with a view, woke up early, and got all ready to be
wowed. As I peeked out the window to find a dull brightness, the obvious
hit me. The sun does not rise on the water on the West Coast. There will
never be an ocean sunrise to see here. I checked all the boxes, except
the most important one.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of my time spinning my wheels, optimizing for the wrong
variables. I look up the time of the sunrise but don&#x2019;t check where it
rises from. I&#x2019;m working to be smarter, but it&#x2019;s hard. These things
aren&#x2019;t obvious, at least to me.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-for-the-wrong-variables">Optimizing for the Wrong
Variables</h3>
<p>I&#x2019;m reading The Phoenix Project, a fictional book about a company in
hot water. In it, a board member points out that fixing anything other
than a bottleneck does nothing. You can get all the little details
right, but if you are facing the wrong direction, you will go nowhere
fast. The same principle applies to my sunrise shenanigans. I could&#x2019;ve
done all the prep I wanted, but nothing would change my facing the wrong
way.</p>
<p>How do you learn to ask the right questions? How do you learn to find
the sunrise? I&#x2019;m not sure yet. Decisive by Dan and Chip Heath is
pointing me in the right direction. In it, they suggest the obvious
solution of asking others who&#x2019;ve done the same. So you ask your friend
who is up early or loves the sun.</p>
<p>I did not think to do that, mainly because none of my friends appear
to care about sunrises. I don&#x2019;t often care. But once in a blue moon I
get a hankering to see the golden ball that keeps me warm. I&#x2019;m not sure
if I&#x2019;m trying to give thanks or say hi. There is no real purpose to my
morning rise.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-the-unexpected">The Power of the Unexpected</h3>
<p>When I do manage to see the sunrise, it is always by accident. I stay
up so late that I hear the birds chirping and see the soft glow melt
through the sky. I fall asleep at 7 PM and wake at 5, unable to find my
bed again.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I woke up so early I was guaranteed to see the
sunrise. I drove my little self to Malibu, arriving before the beach
even opened. That time I didn&#x2019;t look up the time of the sunrise. I
arrived at 6 AM sharp, ready to enjoy. I got so cold that after 30
minutes of anxious waiting, I left the beach before the sun broke the
horizon at 6:45.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-find-bottlenecks-and-sunrises">How to find bottlenecks
(and sunrises)</h3>
<p>It&#x2019;s funny, I started this week&#x2019;s idea with the hope I would write
about finding bottlenecks analytically. What I&#x2019;m finding is that
analytics is not enough. The problem is not crunching the numbers
harder. The problem is a blindness to important details.</p>
<p>Trying harder does not fix a blind spot. You need a new way of seeing
things, you need to step away from the problem. The best way to find a
bottleneck is to try something new and strange. Jolt yourself into a new
perspective.</p>
<p>How do you change your perspective? What jolts you into a new way of
looking at your problems?</p>
<h2 id="cause-of-the-week">Cause of the Week</h2>
<p>There are a couple of <a
href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/discover-charities/where-to-give/west-afghanistan-earthquake/">notes
about this week&#x2019;s charity</a>. First, giving <em>after</em> a disaster
can be a powerful way to help. Most stop giving after an event fades
from the headlines, even as help is still needed. Second, Charity
Navigator is an excellent resource for finding and supporting effective
charities. Please consider giving via Charity Navigator to relief for
the devastating earthquake in Afghanistan.</p>

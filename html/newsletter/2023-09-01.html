				People who brag about moving to save on taxes</a> - There are a couple
			things I love about this. First, it forces an encounter with reality.
			It&#x2019;s easy to talk about taxes in general and hard (but more important)
			to talk about them in particular. Second, I love the attitude promoted
			in this article. When we frame our spending as investment, we put skin
			in the game and act with more integrity.</li>

	<blockquote>
		<p>You can tell this by asking them this: &#x201C;Can you tell me under which
			circumstances you&#x2019;d be happy to pay more taxes? I&#x2019;d love specifics.&#x201D;
			They will not be able to give them to you. In a democracy, you vote and
			accept you can&#x2019;t control every cent. No country would function like
			that.</p>

				Phones and the Problem with Profits</a> - There are a few interesting
			parts to this article. First, it brings specific attention to a big and
			complex problem: the prison industrial complex. My brain glazes over
			when I hear big words like that. Reading this brought the problem into
			sharp focus. Second, I love to see innovative business structures.
			Running this company as a not for profit is an interesting approach that
			I bet we could use across other industries that work with vulnerable
			populations. Finally, this is a &#x201C;Switch&#x201D; style approach to problem
			solving. The prison industrial complex is thorny, but these founders
			identified a bright spot (phone calls) and built a targeted
			solution.</li>

	<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>The Secret History by Donna Tartt - Not going to lie, the ending
			here is a downer. The book remained a page turner throughout, thrilling
			till the end. I loved reading it, though I&#x2019;m not sure I can say I loved
			the book as a whole. A little on the dark side for my taste but worth
			the read.</li>
		<li>Babel by Gaston Dorren - I might buy this book and make it part of
			my permanent collection. One of the most illuminating books I&#x2019;ve ever
			read, it is opening the world of languages to me. Pushing me down a path
			of learning linguistics or the &#x201C;rules&#x201D; of languages as a way of learning
			more of them.</li>
		<li>A War of Witches by Timothy Knab - I have no clue what to make of
			this book. Part autobiography, part fiction, all fascinating. I&#x2019;m
			fascinated by pre-Colombian culture and this hits the spot. With a dash
			of the language (Nahuatl), I&#x2019;m hooked. One interesting note here is that
			the literature on Aztec and Mayans is so much richer in Spanish. If you
			want to learn about those cultures, your best bet is googling around in
			Spanish.</li>

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-good-as-the-enemy-of-great">Idea of the Week:
		Good as the enemy of great</h2>
	<p>I remember Andy Mineo saying once that humans love boxes. He was
		talking about it in the context of his song, Anything But Country. In
		there, he talks about how one experience led him to write off a whole
		genre. Why?</p>
	<p>Because it&#x2019;s easier to put things in boxes. It&#x2019;s easier to box up our
		experiences into tidy little segments. Dealing with the unknown is scary
		and uncertain.</p>
	<p>While Andy Mineo talks about this experience with people, I think we
		see it with decisions as well. Last week my dream apartment in my dream
		area of LA became available. I went to see it and came away lovestruck.
		A one bedroom with a living room that doubles as a second bedroom.
		Separate entrances. Fountains, tiling, the whole 9. Not to mention
		cheaper than my current digs.</p>
	<p>If I wanted to stay in LA, that was the spot to be. That apartment is
		a place I can see myself in for years. I can imagine myself becoming a
		part of the community, digging my roots deep.</p>
	<p>Yet doubt crept in. I don&#x2019;t rent that apartment unless I&#x2019;m sure I
		want to be here long term. If I&#x2019;m not in LA, I&#x2019;m not sure where I go. I
		boxed LA up into a nice, neat package full of great food and fun
		times.</p>
	<p>My LA box is clean and simple. My post LA box is a mess, jumbled with
		random ideas and scraps of plans. I love the simplicity of staying in
		LA. It&#x2019;s a good life here.</p>
	<p>Therein lies the problem. When I box something as good and compare it
		to something unboxed, the comparison is unfavorable. My inability to see
		the complexity of my life in LA and the lack of clarity about my life
		after complicated my decision.</p>
	<p>Once I made the decision (to leave, that is), a funny thing happened.
		The unknown became clear. Within 20 minutes of making the decision, I&#x2019;d
		planned out my next few years. I felt the relief of certainty for the
		first time in months.</p>
	<p>It&#x2019;s unfortunate but we aren&#x2019;t great at holding many ideas in our
		head. It&#x2019;s this limit that causes our difficulty with contemplating the
		good and the unknown. Unfortunately, to find the great, we need to turn
		down the good before we know anything about the great.</p>
	<p>We love our boxes and we love them one at a time. I love the phrase,
		&#x201C;Burn the boats.&#x201D; There&#x2019;s a complicated history to that quote, but in
		this context it makes sense. Burning the boats works because of our
		psychology. We <a href="https://medium.com/p/662882bbcd54">suck at
			choices</a>. The best way to make them is to shrink them.</p>
	<p>To find the great then, burn the good.</p>

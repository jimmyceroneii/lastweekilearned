the Social Web</a> - I opt out of most social platforms, so I imagined I
understood why. I&#x2019;m embarrassed to admit I did not understand why until
reading this. The first half of this is required reading. I&#x2019;m skeptical
of the second half, the proposed solution.</li>

<p>Innovation on these platforms is dying. Third party apps are taken
down, and there is little diversity in the UI choices. We become passive
consumers of UX decisions by the tech giants, and we don&#x2019;t have any

the cloud to scale Etsy</a> - One my crusades as a software developer is
to help the average person understand tech. An early misconception of
mine was that tech made everything easy. Read this to understand why
something as conceptually simple as changing the computer you runs
things on becomes wildly complex.</li>

<p>Etsy relied on physical hardware in two data centers, presenting
several scaling challenges. With their expected growth, it was apparent
that the costs would ramp up quickly. It affected product teams&#x2019; agility
as they had to plan far in advance for capacity.</p>

Shares His Truth</a> - I know I&#x2019;m not very &#x201C;online&#x201D; but this article
cemented it for me. One of my favorite artists underwent tremendous
controversy and I had no clue. I&#x2019;m not sure what to think here. On one
hand, I see someone taking some degree of accountability, which is rare.
On the other I&#x2019;m skeptical because that is easy to talk about and hard
to do.</li>

curiosity built into my genes, captured by the vastness of our planet,
and my insatiable desire to experience all that this world has to

happens to take on the power of place in work with refreshing nuance and

<p>Doubling down on physicality is also how I&#x2019;ve managed to &#x201C;trick&#x201D;
myself into writing hundreds of thousands of words these past few years

world, the direct interaction with people &#x2014; it&#x2019;s as collaborative as
anything (even if nobody else knows they&#x2019;re collaborating). Alone, at
home, I&#x2019;m lazier than a geriatric</p>

impact of that UX decision.</li>

<h2 id="media-im-consuming">Media I&#x2019;m Consuming</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;m continuing my shift away from writing about books specifically to
writing about media more broadly. I&#x2019;m learning more than I normally do
from shows and TV, so I want them to be represented. Someday soon I hope
to include podcast content in here, but for now we will keep it
simple.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m going to write about 3 pieces of media this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babel No More (The Limits of Language Learning)</li>
<li>New Amsterdam (How can I help?)</li>
<li>War of the Witches (Dreams)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="babel-no-more">Babel No More</h4>
<p>I am psyched about this book. I recently finished reading Babel,
which is about the 20 most popular languages in the world. Great book,
highly recommend. Babel No More is less about languages and more about
those who learn them. In here, I learned the word hyperpolyglot, which
is someone who speaks more than 6 languages.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#x2019;m a little let down reading this so far. Not because
of the quality of the writing, it&#x2019;s great. More because of the
conclusions of the book thus far. They debunk the presence of people who
speak 50+ languages &#x201C;fluently.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s silly, but I rather hoped that with
enough work and tricks I could speak somewhere in that ballpark.</p>
<p>The most useful idea I&#x2019;ve come across so far is the expansion of my
definition of language acquisition. Until pushed, I thought I could
define fluency. Yet I&#x2019;m realizing how complex the definition is. Does
reading a language count? What if you can speak it but not write it?
What if your abilities are limited to specific settings (business for
example)?</p>
<p>The complex reality of language acquisition is cheering me up. I
don&#x2019;t have to chase the hopeless definition of &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; speech for
knowledge of various languages to be useful. I&#x2019;m discovering language as
a tool rather than an abstract goal to be reached.</p>
<h4 id="new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</h4>
<p>There&#x2019;s a simple question the main character asks, &#x201C;How can I help?&#x201D;
There&#x2019;s something reminiscent of Switch, one of my favorite books, in
that question. I would recommend watching this show for a masterclass in
how to manage organizational change. Thrilling stuff for a team building
nerd like myself.</p>
<h4 id="war-of-the-witches">War of the Witches</h4>
<p>A strange book, unlike any I&#x2019;ve come across before. One of my key
takeaways here is the power of dreams. I&#x2019;m dragging my feet on it, but I
want to start keeping a dream journal. I&#x2019;m not sure how significant
dreams are, but I&#x2019;m hesitant to dismiss them until I know more about my
own.</p>
<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-opposing-action">Idea of the Week: Opposing
Action</h2>
<p>There&#x2019;s a concept from Alcoholics Anonymous called opposing action
that I love. The idea is to change your life, and do the opposite of
what you&#x2019;ve been doing. The radical nature of opposing action conceals
how commonplace it is. To some degree, any change is an act of opposing
action.</p>
<p>We don&#x2019;t call it opposing action when we eat healthier. But that is
what it is. Instead of eating junk food, you do the opposite and eat
vegetables. What I love about the concept of opposing action is that it
acknowledges the difficulty of any such change.</p>
<p>When we start eating healthy, it will feel unnatural. We as humans
struggle with change. Normal is comfortable and safe, even if it hurts
in the long run. The problem with many of our attempts at change is we
assume it will be easy.</p>
<p>Eating better is healthier, so we will be motivated, right? We
imagine that our motivation will never waver and we will love the
change. The truth of the matter is that change is uncomfortable. To a
certain degree, it threatens our feeling of safety. Change must be
managed with great compassion for ourselves.</p>
<p>All change, even positive change, is experienced as a threat. I grew
up with a lot of chaos and drama. Through therapy, I&#x2019;m working to bring
peace to my relationships. You would think I would love that change. But
I don&#x2019;t. Without all the drama, my life feels boring.</p>
<p>Even as I know I&#x2019;ll be happier in the long run, I can&#x2019;t resist the
temptation to inject chaos into my life. Just as my life calms down, I
start a new fling I know won&#x2019;t work out. I feel safer with a little bit
of chaos. I&#x2019;m working to change it, but that&#x2019;s what I know. Changing it,
even as it helps my life, is a huge lift.</p>
<p>I guess I write all this to say: be gentle. Change is hard. Change is
slow. Best of all, once we finish changing, we forget we&#x2019;ve changed. The
changed life becomes the new normal. Don&#x2019;t forget to be grateful for the
changes you&#x2019;ve already made. And be gentle with the changes you are
making now.</p>

Vision</a> - There is a throwaway line in here that blows my mind. The
problem of motion sickness plagues 50% of all VR users. Scott Galloway
holds this up as one of the (many) reasons he thinks VR will fail. Apple
sidestepped this problem with an AR/VR hybrid. I did not fully
understand what they pulled off until reading this. Incredible
stuff.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I would absolutely pay for a device to have a huge workspace with me
anywhere I go, and while I will reserve judgment until I actually use a
Vision Pro, I could see it being better at my desk as well.</p>

Computing is Real. It Will Simulate the Subamotic World</a> - The long
game of VR lives in the quantum world. To simulate with the fidelity we
want, the only future is quantum. While that future is exciting, it is
far off. Useful quantum is closer than we think. Why? Quantum scales
differently. 10 bits of traditional computing hold 1024 pieces of
information. 10 quantum bits holds, well, a lot more.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Exponential power takes hold quickly. Each qubit can represent two
states at once, so two qubits can represent four states (22), three
qubits can represent eight (23), and so on. Just 64 qubits have the
potential to represent 264 states at once: more than 18 billion
billion.</p>

Few Laws of Getting Rich</a> - Not what I expected and I&#x2019;m pleasantly
surprised. There aren&#x2019;t rule for getting rich, but there are rules for
the costs of wealth. Well played Morgan. Clickbait, but good.</li>

<p>Warren Buffett once said that he often hears rich people talk about
how dangerous a welfare society is, creating a generation of moochers
reliant on food stamps and unemployment benefits. But &#x201C;these same people
are leaving their kids a lifetime supply of food stamps and beyond&#x201D; he
said.</p>

Costco Convinces Brands to Cannibalize Themselves</a> - I love a deep
dive. Costco flies under my radar and after this, I&#x2019;m making a point to
change that. How did they survive the ruthless Targets, Amazons, and
Walmarts of the world? I&#x2019;ll be giving that thought.</li>

<p>Kirkland&#x2019;s success defies our intuition and experience. Shouldn&#x2019;t

programmers believe about the law</a> - The title is great for SEO. But
it sells this short and niche. Anyone not in law could learn from this.
As a side note, I&#x2019;m shocked by how much I&#x2019;ve learned watching 2 seasons
of Suits. The article made so much more sense a second time around.</li>

<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;m reading a couple of history books at the moment. The first is a
memoir about pre-Mao China. The era is a black hole in my mind and I&#x2019;m
excited to learn more. The second is a history of all of Russia. From
the Kievan Rus of the 800s to now. Russian history is yet another black
hole to me, one I&#x2019;m finding an increasing weakness.</p>
<p>On my shelf are a collection of nonfiction books I hope will change
my mind. When I first graduated school, my friend Neil and I read a set
of books that changed our minds. I think I found the second set of such
books. More updates to come here. The first in the batch is called
Decisive by Dan &amp; Cheap who wrote Switch, which I&#x2019;m coming back to
as well.</p>
<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-you-are-what-you-can-risk">Idea of the Week:
You are what you can risk</h2>
<p>Scott Galloway is one of my favorite podcasters. Why? He brings
levity to complicated business ideas. Thanks to him, I learned more
about corporate governance than I dreamed to learn. One time he
explained his approach and the secret to his popularity.</p>
<p>As an independent personality, he can take risks CNBC can&#x2019;t. You
cannot call Mark Zuckerberg a mendacious fuck on live TV. Scott is able
to take risks most pundits can&#x2019;t. There&#x2019;s a variety of reasons for his
risk tolerance, independent wealth being one of them.</p>
<p>Scott is an anomaly. Let me bring this closer to home. I&#x2019;m watching
Suits. The advantage of young lawyers is they are able to risk their
time. Families aren&#x2019;t waiting at home, time is not running out on
them.</p>
<p>One of my work superpowers is my ability to risk my intelligence. For
some reason, I don&#x2019;t give a fuck if people think I look dumb. I risk my
intellectual reputation day in and day out, asking stupid questions. My
reward? I learn fast and before long the questions start to make
sense.</p>
<p>We all differ in our risk profiles. Our biggest strengths lie in the
regions where we risk little and others risk much. What do you hold
loosely that others hold close? Alternatively, what can&#x2019;t you risk?</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll leave you with the newsletter that got me thinking about all
this. Soren, I presume a designer, puts out a few silly designs a week.
No one at Apple would ever do this. But Soren does. He&#x2019;s able to risk
looking like a goof. In the process, he comes off as both endearing and
sharp. I found his <a

Roman Empire Edition</a> a perfect example of what makes him
special.</p>
<h2 id="cause-of-the-week">Cause of the Week</h2>
<p>Nothing here this week, but I&#x2019;m working on something. I want to take
this up a notch, at least for this month.</p>

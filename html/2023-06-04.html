the &#x2018;Iranian Spring&#x2019; of 1979</a> &amp; <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/25/the-twilight-of-the-iranian-revolution">The
Twilight of the Iranian Revolution</a> - The Middle East has my full
attention of late. Iran in particular and its history are gripping. My
Uncle sent me some YouTube videos of Tehran and the place is a strange
mix of familiar and foreign all wrapped up in a quasi secretive box.
These articles unwrap the region a little, hinting at the depths of
it.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.nateliason.com/p/get-rich-creator-economy">How
to Get Insanely Rich in the Creator Economy</a> - I have not read an
article like this in years, if ever. A cunning piece of satire that
hooked me on dreams of fabulous riches before the crushing realization
that comes at the end. Well done, I tip my cap to you Nat Eliason.</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/02/russia-creeping-annexation-belarus/622878/">The
Russian Incursion No One is Talking About</a> - I&#x2019;m embarrassed to say I
missed this completely. Belarus slipped away while we all watched
Ukraine. I&#x2019;m reminded of John Oliver&#x2019;s Last Week Tonight on the
Belarusian dictator, but I was less aware of the democratic reforms and
supposed military neutrality of Belarus. The more I learn this is a
tragedy we will look back on.</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/the-death-of-self-driving-cars-is">The
death of self driving cars is greatly exaggerated</a> - To be honest,
it&#x2019;s been years since I devoted serious thought to self driving cars.
Yet amid all the hype of web3, 3D printing, and more, the self driving
industry is quietly chugging alone. William Gibson said, &#x201C;The future is
already here, it&#x2019;s just not evenly distributed,&#x201D; is right on here. When
I visited San Francisco, the sheer number of Waymo cars blew me away.
They are coming to the rest of the country more quickly than we
imagined.</li>

href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos">First
Impressions of Vision Pro and VisionOS</a> - I love John Gruber and this
post hit me in a way few tech posts do. While I think AI is the winning
tech of this era, I&#x2019;m reconsidering after reading this. Apple knocked it
out of the park IMO and reading this gave me chills.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Land - Neil and I just wrapped this one up. While talking about it,
I said this isn&#x2019;t a book I will consciously reference, but it&#x2019;s on that
will change the way I think about land from here on out. It&#x2019;s hard to
succinctly say what this book will change, but there&#x2019;s something
fundamental about it. If I had to pick one takeaway, it would be the
question, &#x201C;How much land does one person need?&#x201D; That feels like the
root. What is land for? Who is it for? Those questions will be haunting
my mind for a while.</li>
<li>Your Money or Your Life - Money and I have a complex relationship. I
won&#x2019;t say this book helped simplify it, but it did help me see it with
clarity. I&#x2019;ve got a ways to go, but I&#x2019;m thankful for this book. It
helped me see that an unconventional life and financial stability can in
fact coexist.</li>
<li>Anxiously Attached - Few books have wrecked me like this one. If all
books were this tender and kind, the world would be a better place. If
you struggle with security in relationships, I can&#x2019;t recommend this more
highly.</li>
<li>The Pale King - I circle David Foster Wallace like a wary vulture.
The pickings look good, but I can&#x2019;t tell if his books still bite post
mortem. My friend Will finally pulled me down out of the sky to give the
prose a try. So far I&#x2019;m duly impressed by the poetry of his words.
Here&#x2019;s to hoping my feeble mind can figure out the themes lurking in the
plot.</li>
<li>The Secret History - I loved Goldfinch and so far I&#x2019;m digging this
one. To be honest, I&#x2019;m getting Catcher in the Rye vibes here. I hated
Catcher in the Rye, but this feels like what that book could (and
should) have been so far.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://grex.substack.com/p/say-hello-to-friends">Friends</a> - I
love the idea of old Instagram. In some ways my family recreated it with
a Frameo digital photo display. I love sending photos to a few people
and I hear that was Instagram in the early days. I&#x2019;ll be trying this one
out soon.</li>
<li><a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web-roulette/id6448401688">Web
Roulette</a> - When you can take a vice and bring it into the light, I
think it&#x2019;s healing. Here the developers take a bad habit (doom scrolling
sites) and enshrine it in fun.</li>

<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-theres-no-such-thing-as-perfect-timing">Idea of
the Week: There&#x2019;s no such thing as perfect timing</h2>
<p>As I referenced last week, I&#x2019;m always looking for the smooth life. I
go to therapy in hopes I magically solve my problems. I went to couples
counseling in hopes it would fix my ailing relationship. I&#x2019;m not looking
for a shortcut, but I am looking for a guarantee.</p>
<p>As I start to move on from my relationship, my grip on the right way
to do things is loosening. I realize it should have loosened long ago. I
looked for the right way to grieve my grandpa and failed to find it for
over a year. I&#x2019;ve searched for the right way to manage money and the
right time to invest it to no avail.</p>
<p>More and more I&#x2019;m finding just how much time I waste waiting for the
right time. I&#x2019;m always hoping to find some elusive point of readiness.
But there is none. Life is unprecedictable and complex. We don&#x2019;t know
what comes next, or how much time we have.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s good to be wise, to take our time. But it&#x2019;s foolish to assume
our time is infinite and that we will feel ready. If you were ready for
it all, would life even be worth living?</p>
<p>The bush I&#x2019;m beating around here is that a couple of months after
ending an engagement, I&#x2019;m dating again. All my systems scream at my
foolishness. I should wait for therapy and the books to fix me. I should
wait till I&#x2019;m &#x201C;healed&#x201D;. There&#x2019;s wisdom there, no doubt.</p>
<p>But my gut says I&#x2019;m ready for another one. Part of what I learned in
my first relationship is how much joy I get from a relationship. I want
another one. It&#x2019;s bad timing and it&#x2019;s not the &#x201C;right way&#x201D; to do it.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve lived that way long enough though. I&#x2019;m done second guessing
every choice. I might be wrong about my readiness. I will never know
unless I try.</p>
<p>While this applies to my admittedly sad love life, I think it applies
elsewhere. Are you ready to start the company? Have a kid?</p>
<p>Are you waiting for a legitimate reason or are you just afraid?
Sometimes we miss out on what we most want for fear of having it in
imperfect circumstances. We assume there&#x2019;s some day we will have the
energy to start that company or raise that child.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s responsible things we can do to prep, sure. But most of us
are far past that. We&#x2019;ve done the work, we are just scared.</p>

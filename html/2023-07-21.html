				Finds (GPT, Inflation, Elites, Nassim Taleb)</a> - There&#x2019;s so much in
			here to dig into. Most impactful so far is the artificial constraint on
			supply we are creating for our best institutions. The point of education
			is not to exclude, but to advance. As Scott Galloway says, we need more,
			not better, at this point.</li>

	<blockquote>
		<p>He argues that there&#x2019;s a surplus of smart, young Americans fighting
			for admission to the same elite colleges and graduates fighting for the
			same prestigious jobs. The number of people gunning for these elite
			schools and employers is rising much faster than the number of available
			slots. That&#x2019;s partially why schooling and urban housing prices are
			rising so fast.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>If we somehow pack a ship with humans and supplies and travel at that
			speed towards the nearest star, it would take more than 30,000 years.
			30k years might as well be a billion; when compared to our 100 year

	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		<p>This system of doing things made me happy because it didn&#x2019;t leave us
			holding a bag full of promises. Just talking about something didn&#x2019;t
			commit us to spending time on it later. By disconnecting the talk from
			the commitment, this gave us the freedom to talk about all kinds of
			stuff without worry of somehow ending up with tons of stupid and useless
			items down the road.</p>

	<h2 id="books-im-reading">Books I&#x2019;m Reading</h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Skull Water by Heinz Insu Fenkl - I&#x2019;ve only read the introduction so
			far but I&#x2019;m already hooked. A quasi autobiographical novel about Korea
			post Vietnam War is so up my alley it&#x2019;s not even funny.</li>
		<li>F*ck Love by Michael &amp; Sarah Bennett - I am learning so much
			it&#x2019;s not even funny here. How I didn&#x2019;t know some of this blows my mind.
			But anyone dating right now needs to read this. It&#x2019;ll either save you
			from painful relationships or at least show you why you keep running to
			them.</li>
		<li>The Secret History by Donna Tartt - I took a break from this one
			this week. Excited to get back to it on my plane back ride from the
			frigid place that Phoenix is.</li>

		<li><a href="https://clipdrop.co/stable-doodle?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Clipdrop</a>

			tools so this one is now on the list!</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/project-e-ink">Project E
				Ink</a> - I love the idea of interactive low light devices. They save
			your eyes and just look incredible. This is one of my favorite finds
			yet.</li>
		<li><a href="https://speakai.cc/">SpeakAI</a> - I&#x2019;m not sure if this one
			is ready for the prime time yet, but it&#x2019;s a fascinating stab at language
			learning. For me, the most difficult thing is learning the
			conversational flow. While this isn&#x2019;t perfect, it&#x2019;s a step up from rote
			memorization or expensive one on one conversations.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.awsdocsgpt.com/?ck_subscriber_id=1987383695">AWS Docs
				GPT</a> - If I know anything about Amazon, it&#x2019;s that their obsession

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-the-power-of-place">Idea of the Week: The Power
		of Place</h2>
	<p>Part of the reason I love to travel is to see how powerful places
		are. One of my dearly held principles is that power is not inherently
		bad, but dangerous. Great power is not a curse, but a burden. The same
		power that gives good can bring evil.</p>
	<p>Every place exerts a powerful and thus dangerous pull. Los Angeles is
		powerful for the fame and fortune concentrated in it. I&#x2019;m in Phoenix
		this week and experiencing a new kind of power: heat.</p>
	<p>The same heat that brings people here from the cold north comes with
		great danger. Climate change is exacerbating the changes, but to some
		degree Phoenix always held power like this. You see the influence of
		this power everywhere. In the architecture, in the habits of the people,
		in the food.</p>
	<p>It&#x2019;s the etches this power draws in the culture of a place that
		fascinates me.</p>

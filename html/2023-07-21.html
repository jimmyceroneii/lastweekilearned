				Finds (GPT, Inflation, Elites, Nassim Taleb)</a> - There&#x2019;s so much in
			here to dig into. Most impactful so far is the artificial constraint on
			supply we are creating for our best institutions. The point of education
			is not to exclude, but to advance. As Scott Galloway says, we need more,
			not better, at this point.</li>

		<p>He argues that there&#x2019;s a surplus of smart, young Americans fighting
			for admission to the same elite colleges and graduates fighting for the
			same prestigious jobs. The number of people gunning for these elite
			schools and employers is rising much faster than the number of available
			slots. That&#x2019;s partially why schooling and urban housing prices are
			rising so fast.</p>

		<p>This system of doing things made me happy because it didn&#x2019;t leave us

		<li>F*ck Love by Michael &amp; Sarah Bennett - I am learning so much

			But anyone dating right now needs to read this. It&#x2019;ll either save you

		<li>The Secret History by Donna Tartt - I took a break from this one

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-the-power-of-place">Idea of the Week: The Power
		of Place</h2>
	<p>Part of the reason I love to travel is to see how powerful places
		are. One of my dearly held principles is that power is not inherently
		bad, but dangerous. Great power is not a curse, but a burden. The same
		power that gives good can bring evil.</p>
	<p>Every place exerts a powerful and thus dangerous pull. Los Angeles is
		powerful for the fame and fortune concentrated in it. I&#x2019;m in Phoenix
		this week and experiencing a new kind of power: heat.</p>
	<p>The same heat that brings people here from the cold north comes with
		great danger. Climate change is exacerbating the changes, but to some
		degree Phoenix always held power like this. You see the influence of
		this power everywhere. In the architecture, in the habits of the people,
		in the food.</p>
	<p>It&#x2019;s the etches this power draws in the culture of a place that
		fascinates me. The way people move in response to a place, what they
		build. We are all products of place. In an ever more global world, these
		differences between places are disappearing. Articles like <a
			href="https://getmatter.com/email/25599121/?token=25599121%3AUcwzFCp0SUHRNcIMNiyS28l4XYw">The
			emergence of &#x2018;the global standard diet&#x2019;</a> both confirm the trend and
		scare me.</p>
	<p>If we drift towards sameness, where do we explore? How do we learn
		new ways of moving through the world? It&#x2019;s not inevitable that we become
		more and more alike. The invasion of Ukraine came as a great shock to
		many of us, including me. The world seemed to be converging, not
		diverging.</p>
	<p>There&#x2019;s some duality here. On the one hand, the world is more similar
		than we imagine. Most of us want the same things: safety, food, water,
		and shelter. All across the world, we are more human than anything
		else.</p>
	<p>Yet it&#x2019;s a mistake to assume we are too similar. Failing to
		appreciate difference is just as dangerous as failing to appreciate
		sameness. Even as I share the same earth as someone across the world, I
		would remiss to misunderstand the degree of similarity between us.</p>
	<p>The fading differences may be a temporary trend, a blip on the
		geopolitical radar. But just in case it isn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;m more motivated than
		ever to see not just different cultures, but different places. As I
		learned reading about Krakatoa, places leave indelible marks on us and
		our cultures.</p>
	<p>To understand the many flavors of the world, I believe it&#x2019;s critical
		to encounter new places. I am tempted to try to learn about new cultures
		via Netflix (K Dramas are my thing at the moment) and Duolingo. But it&#x2019;s
		not enough. It&#x2019;s one thing to know a language or a culture. It&#x2019;s another
		to know a place.</p>
	<p>Places are powerful and in many ways, they are the drivers of
		everything else. Just as you can&#x2019;t know your partner until you&#x2019;ve met
		their parents, you can&#x2019;t know a culture until you go to it&#x2019;s
		origins.</p>
	<p>The power of place is the reason I&#x2019;m in Phoenix right now. There&#x2019;s a
		heat wave and it&#x2019;s 115 degrees out. For some, that would be a reason to
		stay away. For me, that&#x2019;s the reason to come. I want to experience the
		power of a place and in Phoenix, heat is power. It shapes the habits,
		buildings, and culture. There&#x2019;s a reason it&#x2019;s the Phoenix Suns after
		all.</p>
	<p>While I read about the heat here, the feeling is indescribable.
		Imagine the heat of an oven blasting your face as you open it. Now
		imagine it spread across your body. That&#x2019;s Phoenix right now. I could
		read about it, but staying inside from 9-9 because the heat is
		intolerable is something else. I know the heat in my bones now.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;ve got lots of places on the list now. South Korea prime among
		them. It&#x2019;s one thing to watch the culture, it&#x2019;s another to see Seoul to
		experience the mix of mountains and ocean that is a peninsula.</p>
	<p>I want to see them just in case we do end up drifting towards
		similarity, undoing the damage of Babel. With AI translation flying at
		us, I believe we will be more and more able to compress our differences,
		imagining they aren&#x2019;t there. To wake ourselves up to the different
		experiences of others, I believe we need to revive ourselves with the
		power of place.</p>

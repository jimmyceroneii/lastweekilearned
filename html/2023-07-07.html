		Play</h2>
	<p>I struggle to rest. I struggle to slow down. At times it feels like
		I&#x2019;m a car stuck in drive. I wonder if the park or neutral just never got
		installed. The replacement seems to be a total shut down. My engine
		overheats and I&#x2019;m forced to spend an awkward night on the side of the
		road, waiting until my engine cools down.</p>
	<p>What&#x2019;s funny about the idea of rest is that it is connected to play
		in my mind. I don&#x2019;t understand this connection fully, but rest and play,
		these seeming paradoxes, live like inseparable twins.</p>
	<p>When I lose rest in my life, so goes play.</p>
	<p>When I lack play, so goes rest.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;m not yet sure how this works and I&#x2019;m even less sure what each of
		these activities truly looks like in my life. But I&#x2019;m starting to poke
		at them.</p>
	<p>One thing I&#x2019;ve noticed about these two is they are sensitive to their
		environment. These two suckers are the canary in the coal mine of my
		life. When they start to head for the exits, I know I&#x2019;m in trouble.</p>
	<p>Yet most often, I only know rest and play are gone far after the
		fact. As it stands right now, they say an Irish goodbye and disappear. I
		only notice when I make my way around them room and find them
		absent.</p>
	<p>One of my goals right now is to better recognize when these leave, or
		better yet, when they start eyeing the exit in the first place. Part of
		the trouble is recognizing what rest and play are in the first
		place.</p>
	<p>If I don&#x2019;t know what they look like, how can I know when they
		leave?</p>
	<p>As a side note, I love that I&#x2019;m already 3 metaphors deep here. Only I
		can relate myself to a car, rest and play to twins and canaries and
		party goers all in 400 words. Love it.</p>
	<p>Rest and play can be elusive, wrapped up in disguises. For me,
		sometimes reading is rest, sometimes it&#x2019;s play and other times it is a
		destructive coping mechanism. Playing Pokemon, a favorite pastime, can
		masquerade as well. What starts as play can easily become escape.</p>
	<p>The only real tell so far is the effect of the activity. Does it
		leave me lighter, better equipped to engage? Or does it drain me? These
		are lagging indicators, which is unhelpful for now. But they are better
		than nothing.</p>
	<p>How do you keep rest and play around? How do you know when they
		leave?</p>
	<p>I have no comment section, so just reach out to me if you know
		me.</p>

			their replies a little bit &#x2013; an obvious comment to make is to provide an

			back-up camera etc) bought from different suppliers by different teams
			and integrated only as switches and lights on the dashboard, all of
			those systems become simple sensors connected to a single software

		<li>Skull Water - I am still slowly working my way through this one.
			Just got through a particularly disturbing stretch. I find this book to
			be realistic, which is good, but more intense than I&#x2019;m used to. I am
			learning so much about a surprising mix of fields here.</li>
		<li>Babel - I continue to love this book. I might end up making this
			part of my permanent collection because of the level of understanding
			I&#x2019;m getting here. Language is one of the keys to understanding culture
			(food &amp; geography being two others). I am hard pressed to find a
			better tour of the world than this so far.</li>
		<li>Korean Script Hacking - My language learning journey is always
			changing. For a while my focus remained on mastering another spoken
			language. Now I am contemplating a gear switch where I become literate
			in 5-6 key languages. Then I pick one to learn to speak.</li>
		<li>Anxiously Attached - I listened this as an audio book but now I&#x2019;m
			diving in and workshopping it. Not an easy read, but an important one
			for anxious folks like me.</li>

			compromising autonomy.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s the goal and I&#x2019;m interested in digging

	<h2 id="idea-of-the-week-procrastination-is-emotional">Idea of the Week:
		Procrastination is emotional</h2>
	<p>Sometimes I fool myself into thinking I&#x2019;m a robot or a plant. If I
		get the right instructions or enough sunlight, I do the right things. It
		is always a rude awakening to realize I&#x2019;m human and I&#x2019;ve got complex
		motivations and desires.</p>
	<p>One of the more inconvenient realities of being human is the
		experience of procrastination. From time to time, procrastination grips
		me. Back in school it was more acute, but it rears it&#x2019;s head from time
		to time.</p>
	<p>With more time to observe it recently, I&#x2019;ve learned some things. The
		most important is that procrastination is never about the task at hand.
		For me, procrastination is an alert to an unrelated, unresolved
		emotional problem.</p>
	<p>Emotional problems are almost never where I look when I start to
		procrastinate. I try everything else first. I eat, drink water, stretch,
		clean, and plan. I do everything I can to stay productive. Yet the
		solution is always writing or talking about my feelings.</p>
	<p>Often, once I write my feelings out I uncover a simple action that
		resolves the dilemma. Maybe I need to have a conversation with a friend,
		respond to a text message, or express appreciation. The fix is always
		small and magical.</p>
	<p>Just today I made a faux pas during a Zoom meeting. I got distracted
		while someone else was talking and my camera was on. I felt terrible for
		losing my focus and failing to show proper respect. I spent an hour or
		so trying to work with little success before I got to my feelings.</p>
	<p>I wrote on a spare pad of paper about my embarrassment and guilt. The
		pressure on me eased. Then I recognized I wanted to apologize. So I did.
		It took all of 30 seconds and afterward I felt like a new man.
		Conscience clear, I dove back into work with relish.</p>
	<p>My experiment for you this week then is to check in with your
		emotions when procrastinating. What unresolved emotional issue is
		holding you back? Is there a simple action you can take to ease up the
		pressure?</p>
	<p>Finally, I would love to hear if you disagree with my diagnosis of
		procrastination. What do you think causes it? What do you do to resolve
		yours?</p>

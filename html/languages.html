Acquisition</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>At the moment I speak English fluently and Spanish passably. I
started learning Spanish in the 8th grade with what my friend and I
called, &#x201C;American Spanish.&#x201D; The class was a joke and I treated language
acquisition that way for a long time. Sometime in my sophomore year of
high school, Spanish became a lifeline. I swam for hours a day and to
keep myself entertained, I would try to think in Spanish.</p>
<p>Thinking became changing the language of my phone to Spanish, reading
the news in Spanish and more. I became a man possessed, soaking myself
in the language to escape my small town. Until college though, my love
affair with Spanish remained one sided. I &#x201C;spoke&#x201D; Spanish but mostly
with myself and my diary.</p>
<p>In college my education moved away from the academic and into the
social. My friends taught me how Spanish is actually spoken and I did my
best to adapt my classroom learning to the real world. After college
came a Spanish drought as the Pandemic kept me locked inside. Moving to
Los Angeles reignited the spark and I now use the language almost
daily.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Unfortunately my acquisition of Spanish is not something I&#x2019;m able to
replicate for future languages. First, it took more than 10 years.
Second, it involved formal schooling, which admittedly did little.
Third, Spanish is a unique language in America. It&#x2019;s easy to use it
daily almost anywhere in the country. Not all languages are as
omnipresent.</p>
<p>Thus, I need something of a new approach for language acquisition. So
far, the most interesting approaches come from Tim Ferris, even as I
don&#x2019;t mention him later in this article. His book, The 4 Hour Chef,
presents surprising lessons as <a
href="https://tim.blog/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/">does
his article</a> about the topic. I have yet to dive into his work, even
as I admire it, so I omit it later.</p>
<h2 id="potential-approaches">Potential Approaches</h2>
<h4 id="start-with-scripts">Start with Scripts</h4>
<p>My unproven theory here is that literacy goes a long way towards
helping language acquisition. Learning letters is comparatively easy
(excepting complex scripts like Japanese and Mandarin) to learning a
language. More importantly, my thesis is that learning scripts is more
durable than learning to speak. There&#x2019;s less to forget, it involves <a
href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.19-11-0253">multiple
representations</a>, and it is easy to practice alone.</p>
<p>One pillar of my theory of language acquisition is that I can learn
many of the worlds scripts. I can learn them while learning other
languages. Thus I can parallelize some of the work of learning a
language. Practically this means that while I&#x2019;m learning to speak
Italian, I can be learning the script for Arabic. Then when it comes
time to learn Arabic, I&#x2019;ve already got a head start.</p>
<p>So far I&#x2019;m using a mix of Duolingo and the <a
href="https://www.alibris.com/booksearch?mtype=B&amp;keyword=script+hacking&amp;hs.x=0&amp;hs.y=0">Script
Hacking book series</a> to pick up scripts. Duolingo is surprisingly
helpful for learning scripts as it&#x2019;s interactive. That said, it lacks
context like all Duolingo lessons do. So you miss out on the nuances of
a script (like the fact Riuel is both R and L in Korean).</p>
<h4 id="technological-immersion">Technological Immersion</h4>
<p>I&#x2019;ve yet to try this approach in earnest outside of my early attempts
with changing the language of my phone. But many of my multilingual
friends learned English by watching Netflix. Thanks to technology, we
can take this approach to extremes. In theory you could turn everything
technological into another language, transforming your digital world
into a learning space. It&#x2019;s a little trial by fire but it&#x2019;s effective,
if not efficient.</p>
<p>The advent of AI takes this further. We can converse online with AI
Chatbots. I had a surprisingly enjoyable conversation with <a
href="https://claude.ai/login">Claude</a> in Spanish earlier today.
Claude is a general purpose Chatbot but below I list out some more
specific &#x201C;AI&#x201D; language tools:</p>

</ul>
<p>I&#x2019;ve yet to give any of these a real college try. But if you have,
please let me know how they work. For now I&#x2019;m sticking with Duolingo,
even as I find it ineffective for anything outside of vocabulary.</p>
<h4 id="old-fashioned-approaches">Old Fashioned Approaches</h4>
<p>In addition to the above, which are a little more novel, there are
tried and true approaches. You can take a class, travel to a new place,
or hire a tutor. I would also put most language apps in the &#x201C;old
fashioned&#x201D; bucket. Most are digital versions of a class, where you
memorize rules mindlessly. Some are getting better, but at their heart
they are all forms of memorization.</p>

<h3 id="a-coda-on-computer-science-languages">A Coda on Computer Science
Languages</h3>
<p>An interesting connection here is that being multilingual is quite
common in the world of software. I&#x2019;ve got a passing knowledge of 3-4
software languages. Perhaps more interesting than the sheer number of
programming languages one can know is the attitude towards learning new
ones. It&#x2019;s seen as part of the trade and not terribly overwhelming. It&#x2019;s
perfectly reasonable to learn a new one in a month.</p>
<p>Further, it&#x2019;s perfectly ok to be passable without shame. There is a
strange focus on becoming &#x201C;native&#x201D; in language acquisition. I see it as
a hindrance to practicing and it does not exist in the world of
software. It&#x2019;s normal to suck at a language and learn languages
pragmatically.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ll need to do more thinking here, but I think there&#x2019;s some richness
to be had in terms of novel approaches from programming language
acquisition.</p>

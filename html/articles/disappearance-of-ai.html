<p>This seems to me like the perfect example of diffusion - everything
will have audio translation and no-one will notice anymore or think of
it as &#x2018;AI&#x2019; just as everything now has image recognition or text
translation. AI is anything that doesn&#x2019;t work yet.</p>

<p>Starting there, we are going to see the disappearance of AI. We are
going to forget what AI looks and feels like as it grows more into our
lives. We are going to take AI for granted in a mere year.</p>
<p>The disappearance could be because of the emergence of crazy new AI.
But we don&#x2019;t need another quantum leap forward for AI as we know it to
disappear. We just need to get used to the AI we have. Humans are great
at adapting to situations.</p>
<p>Changes to our environment rarely lead to long lasting differences in
happiness. We are creatures of habit. AI is powerful, but it will be a
victim of the phenomenon like the washing machine and the plow before
it.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about this change is that we will stop
noticing the presence of AI. We will forget how much it helps us. We
will come to rely on it without thinking. In New Amsterdam, one of those
silly medical dramas I love, the hospital loses power for a night. All
the nurses and doctors are hamstrung. In many ways, they&#x2019;d become
cyborgs, working in tandem with a host of robots that do everything from
monitor a patient&#x2019;s vitals to pump their blood.</p>
<p>Overnight, all the doctors were forced to operate without robotic
assistance. And it changed the game for them. They needed a whole
different set of skills and intuitions. I&#x2019;ve been thinking a lot about
incident management and I think there will be a new class of incident
thanks to AI. More and more of us rely on AI tools, just like those
doctors relied on a host of medical ones. These new tools are incredible
and we should use them enthusiastically and creatively.</p>
<p>Yet what if they disappear for a day? Not from our awareness, as is
already happening, but from our toolkit? What happens if Chat GPT is out
for a day?</p>
<p>Organizations and individuals need to practice for these scenarios.
I&#x2019;m not yet sure how to operationalize this idea, but I&#x2019;m imagining once
a month without wifi. An infrequent but consistent check in to keep our
non-AI skills sharp.</p>
<p>Even imagining an outage like this will be difficult at first. Even
so early in the game, I can&#x2019;t even count how many AI tools I use today.
Many of them will soon just be tools, not AI tools, as we grow. I might
start keeping a list of what I use and downgrade on particular days,
just to make sure I&#x2019;m sharp.</p>
<p>To start, I imagine I will switch back to Chrome from Arc, just to
make sure I remember how to use a &#x201C;normal&#x201D; web browser. Where will you
start?</p>

the Importance of Counterfactuals in Technical Documentation</h1>
<h4 id="the-argument-against-documentation">The Argument Against
Documentation</h4>
<p>As you know, I think of learning as a map. If learning is map making,
most technical documentation is a napkin sketch. Technical documentation
is an afterthought at most companies, if it exists at all. At most
companies, people say things like, &#x201C;self documenting code.&#x201D; As if
reading code should tell you everything you need to know about a
project.</p>
<p>I nodded my head along with that sentiment for a long time, all the
while feeling off about it. I could not put my finger on the error of
their ways. Nor could I explain my behavior. Even as I heard all about
the uselessness of documentation, I wrote reams of it. Documentation
poured out of me like a leaky faucet.</p>
<p>The more I wrote, the more I needed to explain myself to coworkers.
They would wisely ask me about the point of all these words. Why write
when it goes out of date? Why write when the code tells the story just
fine?</p>
<h4

Maximalism: Documentation as Learning</h4>
<p>My coworker is a documentation minimalist, arguing that it is a form
of tech debt. If documentation is about providing guidelines and
recipes, I could not agree more. What I finally realized is that my
motivation for documentation differs.</p>
<p>Why? Because at my core, I&#x2019;m more writer than software engineer. I
came to software late and unwillingly. I&#x2019;ve never given up my liberal
arts background, no matter how technical I become.</p>
<p>For me, writing is a form of learning. Any and all documentation is
valuable because it forces the author to understand the system they
document. Nothing brings clarity like putting the pen to the page. When
we write, we see problems and come up with stories to describe our
work.</p>
<h4 id="the-special-power-of-counterfactuals">The Special Power of
Counterfactuals</h4>
<p>There is a certain kind of writing that is extra valuable:
counterfactuals. A counterfactual is a concept from history which means
an unrealized possibility. Japan becoming a US state is an example of a
counterfactual. It almost happened, but it did not. A counterfactual is
about the choices that fell by the wayside along our journey.</p>
<p>The most valuable information in documentation is the
counterfactuals. To understand a system, you need to understand the
paths not taken. Knowing that you chose Red Panda over Apache Kafka
tells you critical information about the requirements and the problems
your system solves.</p>
<p>Most documentation reads like a timeline. Great documentation reads
more like a map. The paths not taken clearly marked and explained. Do
your future self a favor, make good maps.</p>

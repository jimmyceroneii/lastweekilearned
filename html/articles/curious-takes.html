Opinions: Channeling Curiosity into Meaningful Action</h1>
<p>I am tired of trying to have takes on celebrities of all kinds. I&#x2019;m
tired of hearing about private details I don&#x2019;t want to nor should know.
I am tired of attempting to understand global conflict for which I lack
context.</p>
<p>There is something about being alive today that makes us believe we
know more than we do. I&#x2019;m guilty of it. Since I read the news, I assume
I know about global politics. More and more, I&#x2019;m coming to the
conclusion that I don&#x2019;t know. The world is complex and vast.</p>
<p>There is so much I don&#x2019;t know. I used to pride myself on my takes
about the world and what happens in it. Now I look back at myself and
see my pride. Who am I to say? I want to have less takes and take more
action.</p>
<h2 id="less-takes-more-actions">Less Takes = More Actions</h2>
<p>My gut reaction to this is that I&#x2019;m giving up. In saying less, I am
waving my hands at all the complexity and letting go. I&#x2019;m disengaging.
Yet I&#x2019;m not sure it needs to be that black and white. I can learn with
curiosity without coming up with a &#x201C;take.&#x201D; There&#x2019;s this idea that I need
to form an opinion to take action.</p>
<p>I no longer think that is the case. I do not need to have a &#x201C;take&#x201D; on
Russia Ukraine to rush a donation to the Red Cross. I&#x2019;m not an expert on
the politics of that region, but any fool can see that folks are
suffering. I don&#x2019;t need to pretend to know what I&#x2019;m talking about to
offer help.</p>
<p>I wrote about a slush fund for donations to emergencies last month.
My tentative process is to review where to donate once a week. Right now
I watch the news to feel smart. My goal is that the slush fund gives
purpose to my mindless news consumption. Instead of looking for a
&#x201C;take,&#x201D; I can ask, &#x201C;How can I help here?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I so want to adopt this attitude because I&#x2019;m tired of feeling
powerless as I read the news. It is exhausting to read about the world
crumbling. Knowing a lot about a global crisis is worthless. There is
real power to curiosity, but curiosity leads to action. I want to read
less news yet do more about the little I read.</p>
<h2 id="not-both-sides">Not Both Sides</h2>
<p>There is real danger here of drifting into the false equivalency of
&#x201C;both sides.&#x201D; I want to be clear that saying you don&#x2019;t know is not the
same as saying both sides are equally culpable. It is clear that Russia
is in the wrong for invading a sovereign nation unprovoked. I will take
clear stances when there is wrong done in the world.</p>
<p>But I will no longer dwell on trying to find an &#x201C;interesting&#x201D; take on
the conflict. I&#x2019;m not going to sift through intel in hopes of sounding
intelligent. I&#x2019;m shifting my focus from finding a take to taking action.
In the process, I don&#x2019;t need to know as much.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s surprising, but the bar of knowledge for offering help is low.
You just move towards the suffering. You do not need to be fancy and you
don&#x2019;t need to act like a know it all. You only need to know enough.</p>
<p>Before I sign off here, I want to acknowledge my philosophy is full
of holes I&#x2019;m unaware of. That said, I&#x2019;m confident it is better than my
previous philosophy. If you see holes, please let me know so I can find
my next, better philosophy.</p>

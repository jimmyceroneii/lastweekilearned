		Days in Phoenix</h1>
	<p>I wrote a little bit about this in <a href="./2023-07-14.html">2023-07-14
			&#x2192; 2023-07-21</a>, but I want to expand on it here for my hyper local
		blog. I spent a few days in Phoenix as of late.</p>
	<p>While the weather is easy to focus on, I&#x2019;m going to dig into a
		particular experience that blew my mind. I spent 3 rides in a Waymo
		while in Phoenix. As a hyper nerd, I knew in advance Waymo is firing on
		all cylinders in Phoenix. Thanks to Kara Swisher&#x2019;s excellent show, On, I
		heard the CEO discuss their tech and goals.</p>
	<p>That interview, and the article &#x201C;The death of self driving cars is
		greatly exaggerated&#x201D; I referenced in <a href="./2023-06-04.html">2023-06-04
			&#x2192; 2023-06-11</a> blew my mind. Elon&#x2019;s talk of self driving cars (and the
		lack of payoff there) blinded me to the progress that has been made.</p>
	<p>As a side note, I&#x2019;m writing this article while headed to the airport
		in a Waymo. It feels that safe. As my mom noted, there is a weird roller
		coaster type feel to the vehicle when you first step in. I felt like my
		dog at first. He is scared of anything without an obvious cause to it&#x2019;s
		movements.</p>
	<p>Plastic bags throw him for a loop because he can&#x2019;t see the wind
		blowing them around. The Waymo felt the same at first. It is uncanny to
		see a steering wheel move with no one there to push it around. I usually
		see this shit in horror movies or dystopian robot apocalypses.</p>
	<p>Driving around in Waymo felt like a glimpse into a future haunted by
		robots. So far, this haunting seems rather benign. I&#x2019;m not forced to
		make awkward conversation, there is no decision to be made about
		tipping. I can do whatever I want in the car as it feels incredibly
		private. I can play my own music.</p>
	<p>There are few downsides. Even the ride is surprisingly smooth. The
		ride is smooth and safe, like driving around with your confident but
		cautious friend. I can&#x2019;t complain about any aspect of the experience
		itself.</p>
	<p>It&#x2019;s fun to imagine adding generative AI to the picture. I can see a
		travel mode that discusses the local attractions, even going so far as
		to drop you off at spots you are fascinated by.</p>
	<p>The biggest real downside so far is there is no easier way to
		embarrass yourself than to get in a self driving car. While a Tesla is
		chic and premium, stepping into a Waymo marks you a nerd. The fact it&#x2019;s
		a Jaguar helps, but the whirring and spinning contraptions attached to
		it override that cool factor.</p>
	<p>Overall though, this is an experience I would love in my city. Waymo
		is piloting in Los Angeles soon and I will be an avid user.</p>
	<p>That said, I recognize that this technology comes with huge downside.
		Driving is thus far a peculiarly human occupation. Truck driving is the
		most common occupation in the US and I doubt Uber is far behind. In
		America, we drive. More specifically, humans drive.</p>
	<p>I can imagine that a city like Seoul or Berlin being less affected by
		this technology. But our regulatory environment appears to put as at the
		forefront. We are at the same time most acutely affected by this
		technology and a leader in it.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Let me know if I&#x2019;m wrong here, I&#x2019;m ignorant of worldwide self driving
			trends.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>It would be ignorant to ignore the downsides of this technology. The
		advantages are obvious, as are the drawbacks. In Deaths of Despair, the
		authors point out that the decay of the American middle class and the
		resulting decline in our culture was not inevitable. Other countries
		around the world built more robust safety nets for workers most affected
		by the automation of heavy industry.</p>
	<p>The Rust Belt is not inevitable. On the Tim Ferriss podcast, <a
			href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1lEgrjwkuVdCCj6l4CBXmV?si=bdc453a3580240a1">Richard
			Koch</a> talks about counterfactuals, which is a term to describe
		alternative pasts. We must keep in mind that catastrophic job loss is
		not inevitable here.</p>
	<p>We can reap the benefits of self driving cars (safety, cost, etc)
		while protecting those most vulnerable. We can create thoughtful
		retraining and upskilling programs for drivers across the country.</p>
	<p>We&#x2019;ve done this before. After the end of the second world war, 10
		million Americans came home, their &#x201C;jobs&#x201D; in the war eliminated by
		peace. We took the changing world seriously and adapted with great
		foresight, creating an economic boom that echoes today.</p>
	<p>The time to start preparing is now. Uber and other companies could
		create tremendous goodwill by creating upskilling programs as Starbucks
		has done. The government can manage the transition with caution,
		creating time for us all to adjust to a new world.</p>
	<p>What do you think should be done? Do you know of any bright spots so
		far?</p>

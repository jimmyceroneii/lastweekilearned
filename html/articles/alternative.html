&#x201C;Alternative&#x201D; Investments</h1>
<p>A few years back I got caught up in the idea of alternative
investments. I read the Black Swan and a few other investing books. I
started to imagine how I could generate returns in excess of the stock
market. Could I catch details others missed?</p>
<p>I went far down that path. I tried out products like Masterworks,
Fundrise, and Coinbase. I didn&#x2019;t put much money in any of those, but I
did experiment. Over time, I&#x2019;ve pulled back on all my &#x201C;alternative&#x201D;
investments, excepting one, which I&#x2019;ll cover later.</p>
<p>In my experience, there are 2 key problems with alternative
investments:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&#x2019;t beat the market</li>
<li>They are high fee</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent tons of time trying to find ways to beat the market. My
conclusion is you can beat the market if you are good with options. I&#x2019;m
not good with options and I don&#x2019;t have enough cash on hand to play
around with them. Any other attempt to beat the market is not
sustainable.</p>
<p>Well, with the exception of a single strategy: buy and hold specific
companies. I&#x2019;ve seen that work over long time horizons but it&#x2019;s risky
and I don&#x2019;t love risk. The &#x201C;best&#x201D; and easiest strategy I&#x2019;ve found is to
use low cost index funds.</p>
<p>The challenge with alternative investments is that few things can
beat the market. Hedge funds rarely do it. The problem is not that
alternative investments suck, it&#x2019;s more that they are competing against
an unfair opponent.</p>
<p>The core problem they struggle to overcome is their correlation with
the market. Most alternative investments ride the highs and lows of the
market. In the short term, they might outperform the &#x201C;market.&#x201D; But since
they are correlated with the market, it&#x2019;s not likely they will provide
crazy outsized returns.</p>
<p>To truly beat the market, you need to be able to move in the opposite
direction of the market. You need to benefit from down and up swings
alike. That&#x2019;s where options come in, but those are risky and I don&#x2019;t
understand them.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;pick stocks and stick&#x201D; with them strategy can work because
indices include big losers as well as big winners. 7 companies are
driving the bulk of the S&amp;P 500&#x2019;s recent gains. If you own those 7
companies (or even one of them), you are doing much better than the
market. Great strategy in boom times, risky in bust times.</p>
<p>Back to alternative investments. The real kicker here is the fees.
Platforms like Masterworks take tons of fees. Let&#x2019;s say your alternative
investment platform takes 2% of your gains (or worse, 1% of Assets Under
Management AUM). Index funds from Vanguard charge less than 0.1%, 20X
less. To beat an index fund, your investment platform needs to
outperform an index fund by ~2%.</p>
<p>When the market is up on a good year 10%, you are talking about
outperforming index funds by a minimum of 20%. That&#x2019;s hard as hell. Once
again, I&#x2019;m not say that alternate investments suck. I&#x2019;m just saying the
cards are stacked against their usefulness.</p>

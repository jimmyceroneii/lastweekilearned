		Politics</h1>
	<p>In the podcast I said, &#x201C;Politics is more about sales and alliances
		than it is particular policies or beliefs.&#x201D; Just after that, I said I
		would give the idea more thought. Here I am with a little bit more
		thought.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;m surprised I missed this idea before. Now that I&#x2019;m thinking it, I
		can&#x2019;t unsee it. Politics is social. What do I mean by that?</p>
	<p>The same dynamics we see on the playground take place at a larger
		scale at Washington. Some people are cool, some are not. Some build
		respect, others are bullies. That&#x2019;s an oversimplification, of course,
		but it goes farther than one might think.</p>
	<p>What I find more interesting than the framing though is the impact of
		the mental model. For the longest time, my mental model of politics (and
		religion for that matter) rested on the bedrock of logic. If you laid
		out an argument well enough, people couldn&#x2019;t help but come around.</p>
	<p>Reading the Righteous Mind disabused me of the lofty ideals of human
		logic. I started to understand humans not as logical actors, but
		emotional ones. Yet I see now that I didn&#x2019;t take the thinking far
		enough. The pieces were there. I&#x2019;d read Switch by Dan and Chip Heath and
		learned about the complex dance that is change.</p>
	<p>Their description of change (as well as Nudge) should have been the
		push I needed. Yet still I didn&#x2019;t see it. I still looked at change and
		politics as systems. And to some degree they are. But they are a
		particular kind of system, a social system.</p>
	<p>Why does it matter if it&#x2019;s a social system? You handle a social
		system differently than any other system. A poor Accounting system can
		be fixed with Excel. A poor social system requires a different
		touch.</p>
	<p>Ezra Klein identified a since snuffed out bright spot in Why We&#x2019;re
		Polarized. Back in the day, Congress lived in Washington DC. No matter
		their differences, they lived as neighbors. Proximity is a powerful
		social tool. Used well, it drives affinity that otherwise would never
		grow.</p>
	<p>In a misguided attempt to make Congress more responsive, we began to
		emphasize time spent with their constituents. A noble goal with a
		nefarious impact. Klein&#x2019;s thesis (and my own) is that by ending their
		weak social ties, we created a more polarized political landscape in
		America.</p>
	<p>What this suggests to me is that change may not be as difficult as we
		expect it to be. One of the core tenants of Chaos Theory and Complex
		Systems is that little changes can impact the system in asymmetric ways.
		The reintroduction of wolves to certain National Parks changed the
		ecosystem in myriad and unexpected ways.</p>
	<p>I believe seeing our political system as a social one leads us to
		some unexpected conclusions. The solution to our political malaise could
		be as simple as encouraging friendship across the aisle. Not agreement,
		not assent, but simple friendship.</p>
	<p>It seems trite, but our political progress is better measured by the
		number of casual conversations between Elizabeth Warren and Mitch
		McConnell than anything else. When we are dealing with complex systems,
		symptoms are difficult to treat. Direct treatment rarely responds. We
		must find the unexpected levers that move everything.</p>
	<p>Seeing politics as political makes some problems seem more trivial
		and others more concerning. The growing income inequality in our country
		goes from a minor annoyance to an incredible threat, probably the most
		serious we face. Income gaps mean social gaps. And since politics is
		social, that means political gaps.</p>
	<p>The problems we appear to face are in fact symptoms of causes we
		ignore. I&#x2019;ve yet to give income inequality sustained thought. After
		writing this, I will. I&#x2019;ll let you know what I come up with.</p>

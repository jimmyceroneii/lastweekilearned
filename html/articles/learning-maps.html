	<h1 id="learning-as-map-making">Learning as Map Making</h1>
	<p>I talked about this idea on the podcast a bit in the context of a
		clever tech project. The creators of the project simplified complex
		topics into children&#x2019;s books. I&#x2019;m jealous, I wish I&#x2019;d come up with the
		idea first. For now I will settled for writing about it, game
		recognizing game.</p>
	<p>One of the most important decisions about a map is the scale it
		depicts. What I love about the project I&#x2019;m referencing is their choice
		of scale. Instead of diving into the alleys and sewers of a city block,
		the authors chose to create a huge expansive map. The map is light on
		details, but it prepares you to find more detail.</p>
	<p>In many ways, I think of their map as an interstate map. It will show
		you how to get to the right city. From there, you can consult a more
		specific map to find the hotel of your choice. We often neglect these
		maps. They aren&#x2019;t &#x201C;practical&#x201D; like a guide.</p>
	<p>Our hubris in real world maps carries over to our mental maps. We
		pretend to be closer to understanding than we are. Projects like Cloud
		Native&#x2019;s seem elementary, but they are much closer to what we need than
		we like to admit.</p>
	<p>Getting the scale right is critical. But it&#x2019;s not everything. Another
		trick when creating mental maps is to standardize the maps. I&#x2019;m not
		great at it, but if you know maps, you can derive incredible information
		from one. Those squiggly lines mean the same thing across all maps. Even
		the name of an interstate (whether it&#x2019;s even or odd) carries
		significance.</p>
	<p>In Tim Feriss&#x2019;s article about language acquisition, he recommends
		standardizing your language map with a simple set of sentences that
		reveals the grammar and rules of a language. These sentences are like
		the contour lines of a language, revealing the tricky parts and exposing
		similarities to languages you already know.</p>
	<p>Sometimes maps discourage us from foolish decisions. Maps are not
		reality, but often they are the closest, fastest analogy for reality.
		When contemplating the difficulty of a trip, we consult a map.</p>
	<p>In many ways, the best shallow dives are like consulting a map. When
		you are entering an unfamiliar subject, you want to get oriented. You
		want to find and scan a good map to see where you are at and determine
		where you want to go.</p>
	<p>The shallow dive is the interstate map. It tells you in general where
		things are, how long it will take to get there. The deep dive is the
		city map, showing you all the nitty gritty. We need both of these.</p>
	<p>To recap some of my loose thoughts here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Scale is key to maps, mental or otherwise. Choose the right scale
			map for the job.</li>
		<li>Standardize your maps when possible. If you are learning multiple
			related topics, create structure so you can learn faster.</li>
		<li>Shallow dives are about orientation. Deep dives are about
			details.</li>
	</ul>

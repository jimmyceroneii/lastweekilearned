	<h1 id="my-theory-on-germ-exposure">My Theory on Germ Exposure</h1>
	<p>I&#x2019;m trying to write down fleeting ideas to invite feedback both from
		myself and others. One of my theories, which I hold tighter than I knew,
		is what I call the germ exposure theory. The root of my theory is a
		former coworker who worked on an Epipen replacement. While working on
		it, he learned that part of the explosion in intense allergic reactions
		is due to our lack of exposure to a wide variety of particles.</p>
	<p>We live in more and more sterilized, homogenous worlds. Our systems
		are not made for these worlds. We evolved in a random, chaotic outdoors.
		I&#x2019;ve never verified my coworker&#x2019;s theory, even as I base many of my
		actions on it.</p>
	<p>Why base actions on such flimsy evidence? I tell myself the stronger
		evidence is in the work of Nassim Taleb. Specifically, his book
		Antifragile. In it, he classifies some systems as fragile. When you
		expose them to stress, they shatter. Other systems are resilient. When
		you expose them to stress, they are able to return to their prior
		state.</p>
	<p>Human immune systems, Taleb claims (with some credence I believe),
		are a special kind of system. Immune systems, when functioning well, are
		antifragile. When you expose them to stress, they emerge stronger than
		before.</p>
	<p>Thus underpins my germ exposure theory. Excepting certain organisms
		(anthrax for example), it is advantageous to expose yourself to as many
		particles as possible. Relentlessly cleaning everything everywhere all
		at once is not a sound strategy. That eliminates opportunities for
		growth.</p>
	<p>What does this look like in practice? I routinely eat food that falls
		on the floor. I let my dog (and most dogs) lick my face. I eat before
		washing my hands. I generally behave as if most exposure to germs will
		help rather than harm.</p>
	<p>While this theory seems irresponsible, I think there is room within
		it for acknowledging that some germs are not acceptable at any level. I
		take COVID quite seriously, especially while traveling. Yes I&#x2019;m one of
		those weirdos who still masks up on the flight.</p>
	<p>Now I&#x2019;m certain my theory here is naive and many of the practical
		implications are unwise. I&#x2019;d love to hear all about it. Please help me
		refine my theory and point out it&#x2019;s weaknesses.</p>

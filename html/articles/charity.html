<h2 id="investing-and-charity">Investing and Charity</h2>
<p>Investing is not about making great stock picks. That is luck. Good
investing is all about a system. I hesitate to compare investing and
charity, yet here I go. Charity is an investment in human capital. I&#x2019;m
not on board with effective altruism though I can&#x2019;t disagree with
effective charity.</p>
<p>In the past, my charitable contributions and volunteer work remained
scatterbrained and random. Earnest, yes. Effective, uncertain. As I get
my feet back under me after a season of change, I&#x2019;m reviewing how I
approach charity with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m wrong here, but I&#x2019;ve yet to find an area of life that doesn&#x2019;t
love a system. The simplest systems are rules of thumb for guiding
decisions. I do not want my system to be devoid of emotion. I want my
deepest-held priorities reflected in my giving. My goal here is to
better align with myself, not remove the &#x201C;emotions&#x201D; from my giving. That
said, I&#x2019;m still trying to be smart here.</p>
<p>One upgrade I&#x2019;m looking to make relates to overhead. Charity is best
given to people in need, not administrations. I make exceptions here for
charities I know personally.</p>
<p>One misconception I hold about giving is that small amounts don&#x2019;t
matter. The Bill Gates Foundation needs a system for giving, but not
someone tiny like me. There is truth in my attitude. There are few
consequences if I mismanage my miniature giving budget.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m creating a system for giving more to simplify my life and
decisions than to create an outsized impact. When I find myself
frequently in debates with myself, I make a system. More and more, I&#x2019;m
finding myself struggling with decisions about giving.</p>
<p>There are two categories of decisions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long term initiatives</li>
<li>Emergency short-term giving</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-initiatives">Long-Term Initiatives</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;m struggling to focus on long-term initiatives. I don&#x2019;t know what
matters most to me and where to put my scarce resources. I see a lot of
causes I would love to support every day. Lacking priorities, I agonize
over whether to support a new cause.</p>
<p>I want to clarify for myself which long-term initiatives matter. Then
I want to set up a system to revisit these priorities consistently.
Moving to this flow allows me to check new giving opportunities with
ease. I&#x2019;ve got a simple rule and a way to revisit it.</p>
<p>When I consider long-term projects, many causes come to mind, which
is great! The problem is I struggle to sort these projects into cohesive
categories. In the past, I&#x2019;ve given to RAINN, the Red Cross, ACTS
Holland, and more. So far I find myself giving to education, disaster
relief, and food security. I want to expand my giving to include
environmental protection.</p>
<p>My process will start with listing out all possible charities. I will
filter my list using Charity Navigator, which grades charities based on
impact. Then I&#x2019;ll group them together and rank them.</p>
<h2 id="short-term-initiatives">Short Term Initiatives</h2>
<p>This category is tougher as it is unpredictable. I want to cover a
couple of things here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slush Fund to handle humanitarian crises</li>
<li>Cash Fund for local charity</li>
</ul>
<p>Short-term initiatives are pop-ups. I&#x2019;m thinking of the flooding in
India or the earthquake in Turkey. Global, urgent catastrophes. On a
more local level, I look at buying meals for folks or offering cash
assistance at random.</p>
<p>A &#x201C;slush&#x201D; fund, where I withhold an unassigned chunk of money, would
make sense. The decision-making is easier here. I give until I&#x2019;m out for
the month. Whatever I don&#x2019;t spend rolls over to the next month.</p>
<p>Using these simple heuristics makes charged decisions simple. It lets
me give without fear and then stop without guilt. I&#x2019;m confident in the
&#x201C;slush&#x201D; fund side of this idea, but I&#x2019;m less confident about the cash
fund.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m loath to carry cash and rarely find myself at an ATM. If folks
have suggestions for how to set up a cash &#x201C;slush&#x201D; fund please reach out.
I would love to hear about your practices for charity and how you
identified causes to support. My tentative solution is to get cash back
when I buy groceries which is working well.</p>

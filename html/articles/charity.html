<p>One of my favorite insights from a financial newsletter I follow is
that investing is not about making great stock picks. That is called
luck. Good investing all about a system.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m wrong here, but I&#x2019;ve yet to find an area of life which doesn&#x2019;t
benefit from a system. The simplest systems are principles, rules of
thumb for guiding decisions. In the past, my interaction with charity
felt haphazard. Thanks to planning for a wedding, money got tight and I
shut down most of my giving.</p>
<p>Without a wedding (long story), I&#x2019;m looking to restart my giving. I
want to me more principled in my approach this time around. An important
note here is that I do not want my system to be devoid of emotion.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not a huge fan of the effective altruism movement. I don&#x2019;t think
we can or should take the emotion out of giving. I want my deepest held
priorities to be reflected in my giving.</p>
<p>I want my system to support my most heartfelt causes. My goal here is
to better align with myself, not remove the &#x201C;emotions&#x201D; from my giving.
That said, I&#x2019;m still trying to be smart here.</p>
<p>One &#x201C;logical&#x201D; stipulation I&#x2019;m looking to include in my philosophy of
giving is to look into the amount of money given to charity that goes to
help people vs what goes to overhead. I make exceptions here for
charities I know personally.</p>
<p>When I&#x2019;m giving to a giant charity though, I do care about
efficiency. At scale, the amount of dollars going to help counts.</p>
<p>I think one misconception folks hold about giving is that small
amounts don&#x2019;t matter. The Bill Gates Foundation needs a system for
giving, but not someone tiny like me. To be honest, folks are right.
Small amounts don&#x2019;t move the needle and there&#x2019;s few consequences if I
mismanage my tiny giving budget.</p>
<p>The reason I&#x2019;m creating a system for giving is to simplify my life
and decisions, both now and going forward. When I find myself frequently
in debates with myself, I make a system. More and more, I&#x2019;m finding
myself struggling with decisions about giving.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s two categories of decisions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long term initiatives</li>
<li>Emergency short term giving</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-initiatives">Long Term Initiatives</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;m struggling to prioritize long term initiatives. I don&#x2019;t know what
matters most to me and where to allocate my scarce resources. I see a
lot of causes I would love to support every day. Without knowing my
priorities, I end up agonizing over whether to support a new cause.</p>
<p>I want to clarify for myself which long term initiatives matter. Then
I want to setup a system to revisit these priorities on a consistent
basis (monthly, quarterly) so I can batch the decisions. Moving to this
flow allows me to evaluate new giving opportunities (no for now to all,
review all once a quarter) with ease. I&#x2019;ve got a simple rule and a way
to revisit it.</p>
<p>When I think about long term initiatives, a ton of causes pop to
mind: Red Cross, RAINN, Save the Children, Give Direct, etc. I am
struggling to even categorize these long term initiatives. In the past,
I&#x2019;ve given to RAINN, the Red Cross, ACTS Holland and more. Typically I
find myself giving to education, disaster relief, and food security. I
want to expand my giving to include environmental protection.</p>
<p>I think my process here is going to be listing out all possible
charities, group them together, prioritize them based on my budget, and
go from there. I want to evaluate all these charities with Charity
Navigator as I&#x2019;ll be donating long term here.</p>
<h2 id="short-term-initiatives">Short Term Initiatives</h2>
<p>This category is tougher as it&#x2019;s kind of random. I want to setup a
couple of things here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slush Fund to handle humanitarian crises</li>
<li>Cash Fund for local charity</li>
</ul>
<p>Short term initiatives are pop ups. I&#x2019;m thinking of the flooding in
India occurring right now or the earthquake in Turkey. That&#x2019;s global
stuff. On a more local level, I&#x2019;m thinking of buying meals for folks or
offering cash assistance to the homeless.</p>
<p>In both cases, I think a &#x201C;slush&#x201D; fund of sorts, where I&#x2019;ve got a set
amount of money set aside for each month would make sense. The decision
making is easier here. I give until I&#x2019;m out for the month. Whatever I
don&#x2019;t spend rolls over to the next month.</p>
<p>Using these simple heuristics makes emotionally charged decisions
simple. It lets me give without fear and then stop without guilt. I&#x2019;m
confident in the &#x201C;slush&#x201D; fund side of this idea, but I&#x2019;m less confident
about the cash fund.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m loath to carry cash and rarely find myself at an ATM. If folks
have suggestions for how to setup a cash &#x201C;slush&#x201D; fund please reach out.
I would love to hear about your practices for charity and how you
identified causes to support.</p>

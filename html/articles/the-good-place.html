		Place</h1>
	<p>When I&#x2019;m sad, I lose myself in story. I&#x2019;m lucky my coping mechanism
		is more inconvenient than detrimental. Thank the Lord for that, I know
		there are worse ways to lose yourself. Sometimes when I find myself
		drowning in a good story, I even learn something that brings me back to
		myself.</p>
	<p>Right now I&#x2019;m watching the Good Place. On a purely nerd note, I love
		it for all the ethics I&#x2019;m learning while watching. I never understood
		Kant or Nietzsche until I saw their philosophies played out onscreen.
		What a cool way to teach! I loved my philosophy professor in college,
		but I&#x2019;m sorry Dr.&#xA0;Kambo this is the way to go.</p>
	<p>One thing circling around in my head about the show is based on a Tim
		Ferriss podcast I loved recently. In it, <a
			href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Yldd8VvLO5GjIsFd78gnA?si=2f12eb95cbdd4be6">Simon
			Coronel</a> talks about the day his imposter syndrome disappeared. He
		pulled off a trick he worked on for 10 years. His creative muse came to
		him with an inspired take on it a mere 48 hours before the fateful
		competition. He worked like a dog on it, skipping sleep and went into
		the competition uncertain.</p>
	<p>When he pulled it off (and won top prize), he said he felt his
		decades long imposter syndrome fall away. One of the central themes of
		the Good Place is doing good for no good reason. Good deeds motivated by
		bad desires (even a desire to go to heaven) are tainted. Setting aside
		the implications this idea has for modern Evangelical Christianity, this
		leads to a couple of interesting places.</p>
	<p>I see this working in a couple of directions. First, it means we are
		free from all the obligations to do good for the sake of looking good.
		Second, it means we are imminently redeemable. To quote Ted Lasso, &#x201C;Act
		like a goldfish.&#x201D; The past is useless in determining our goodness. Our
		motives are the good stuff. And those are fleeting. Life is not then a
		long test, but one we must take moment by moment.</p>
	<p>One moment we succeed, the next we fail. With the one having no
		relation to the other. We are constantly tested, which is scary. But we
		are also constantly restarting, which is heartening. Life is nothing if
		bittersweet.</p>

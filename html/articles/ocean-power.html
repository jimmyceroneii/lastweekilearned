	<h1 id="the-power-of-the-ocean">The Power of the Ocean</h1>
	<p>Last week I included an article about dolphin sex in my newsletter.
		It is partly in jest, but there is real depth to the article as well. We
		know so little about the ocean. It is vast and powerful. Beyond us.</p>
	<p>The recent tragedy with the submarine imploding pounded the danger
		and power of the ocean into my skull. The depths of the ocean might as
		well be the surface of mars. They are that foreign to us.</p>
	<p>Kevin Kelly once said to move towards unnameable things in your
		career. More and more I find myself being drawn to the ocean and solar
		power. A strange combination, yet both are frontiers. Frontiers I am
		near.</p>
	<p>I live in Los Angeles, where the ocean is ever present alongside the
		sun. There&#x2019;s not a better place to learn about this combination. I&#x2019;m
		lucky my curiosity coincides with my environment.</p>
	<p>A while ago, I spoke to Neil about the value of knowing about the
		ocean. Simple awareness of tides, rip currents, and more are
		transferrable knowledge. The ocean is present all across the world.
		Knowing a little bit about it gives you access to places everywhere.</p>
	<p>When I think about worthwhile knowledge, I think about breadth of
		application. What can I learn once and apply everywhere? Knowing how to
		pick up a language is one of those skills I put time into because of its
		usability in various contexts.</p>
	<p>I&#x2019;m adding awareness of the water and specifically the ocean. Ocean
		life is unique yet worldwide. Life on the water all across the world
		appears to share surface features. Water people I meet from everywhere
		share a strange set of similarities. I&#x2019;m not aware of their exact nature
		yet, but that connection to the water draws them together.</p>
	<p>I want to know more about that. So in the next few months, I&#x2019;m hoping
		to shift the time I spent playing basketball into the water. I want to
		learn about the waves. I&#x2019;ll let you know what I find.</p>
	<h2 id="song-inspiration">Song Inspiration</h2>
	<p>At the end of each article, I share the song I listened to on repeat
		while writing. This week article&#x2019;s soundtrack was The Cure, from the
		excellent album King&#x2019;s Disease by Nas. A collaboration with Hit-Boy,
		this album and the one&#x2019;s that follow are unreal. A lovely mix of old
		school production with wisdom in the lyrics.</p>

Songs on Repeat While I Write</h1>
<p>In Deep Work, Cal Newport talks about startup and shut down rituals.
One of my startup rituals for writing is to turn on some music. I hear
differing takes on music all the time. Some argue it hinders focus and
in many cases, I find that&#x2019;s true.</p>
<p>Even given the chance it lowers my focus, I keep music on. I love
music, I grew up around it. My dad worked in radio and moonlight as a DJ
on the side. The earliest pictures of me are next to a speaker, smile
wide and spindly legs in motion.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been stuck with the dilemma here for a while, loving music yet
recognizing the pull on my attention. On accident, I found a neat
solution, at least for when I&#x2019;m writing. I pick a single song and listen
to it on repeat while I write.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a few gems here. First, by forcing myself to choose a single
song, I choose one I know I love. Much of the distraction that comes
with music is figuring out whether I like what I&#x2019;m listening to. Picking
a single song eliminates the shuffle. My mind knows it is not in music
exploration mode, it&#x2019;s in writing mode.</p>
<p>Second, there is no skipping. I am not making any music related
decisions while I write. At the most, I&#x2019;m enjoying a song I love. At the
worst, the song fades into the background as it repeats over and over
again.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s song is Anyway by Noah Kahan. Noah is a favorite background
music artist for me. I use Carlo&#x2019;s Song from him often as well. For some
reason, almost all the songs I choose for my repeat sessions are sad,
slow and calm. I cannot seem to find any words in me while listening to
Youngboy NBA.</p>
<p>As I cement the practice of listening to a single song on repeat, I&#x2019;m
starting to incorporate the songs into my articles. I forget to do it
most often, but I&#x2019;m more and more trying to add a producer tag of sorts
in the form of a song. I&#x2019;m undecided about whether to put it at the
start or the end of an article.</p>
<p>My hope is that me (and others) can listen to the song while reading
it for a kind of wine pairing situation. Probably a pipe dream but a fun
one to imagine. Multi-media writing!</p>

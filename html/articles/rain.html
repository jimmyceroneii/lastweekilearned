	<p>My only complaint about Los Angeles weather is the lack of rain. Some
		folks hate the rain. I can understand their perspective. Rain is
		annoying and dreary and cold.</p>
	<p>I love the rain though. I&#x2019;m a hyperactive person driven by guilt.
		Rain gives me an excuse to slow down and take a break. Should I learn to
		give myself a break? Yep. Does rain do the trick for now? Yep.</p>
	<p>One of the challenges I encountered living through a winter in Los
		Angeles was the lack of a break. In the Midwest, winter is a time of
		enforced slowing down. The cold, the snow, and the short daylight make
		it impossible to do all you do in the summer. It is enforced
		hibernation.</p>
	<p>Out here it is a different story. The winter is perfect weather in my
		book. Temperatures rarely climb above 75 or below 60. God must winter in
		Southern California because the weather here is heavenly.</p>
	<p>Yet it does not give me the break I&#x2019;m used to. I suppose what I&#x2019;m
		writing about then is using the weather to modulate your moods. There&#x2019;s
		a real mind-over-matter strain out there in the world. If you think it,
		you can do it.</p>
	<p>I don&#x2019;t buy it. When it rains, it changes how I interact with the
		world. When there is no winter, my life is different. The rhythms are
		different. I love how aloof we humans make ourselves appear. We act
		unaffected by the world around us as if we can shape reality.</p>
	<p>In Walter Isaacson&#x2019;s book about Steve Jobs, he talks about Jobs&#x2019;
		reality distortion field. Jobs could speak things into existence out of
		sheer will. Not all of us are Steve Jobs and not all of Steve Jobs&#x2019;
		desires came into being. We are limited as human beings, that is part of
		the deal.</p>
	<p>I love the rain because it limits me. The rain does what I cannot:
		slow me down. While it&#x2019;s true I should be able to slow down on my own,
		that&#x2019;s not yet reality. I&#x2019;m working on it, my reality distortion field
		is saying things like, &#x201C;You can take PTO.&#x201D; A little less ambitious than
		Steve Jobs but I&#x2019;ll take what I can get.</p>
	<p>Until then though, I will celebrate the rain as everyone else
		grumbles.</p>

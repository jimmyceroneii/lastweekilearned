1. [Friday Finds (GPT, Inflation, Elites, Nassim Taleb)](https://getmatter.com/email/27353362/?token=27353362%3AzqzA7crBOs6BRPtROIj8JMQYoJ4) - There's so much in here to dig into. Most impactful so far is the artificial constraint on supply we are creating for our best institutions. The point of education is not to exclude, but to advance. As Scott Galloway says, we need more, not better, at this point.

> He argues that there’s a surplus of smart, young Americans fighting for admission to the same elite colleges and graduates fighting for the same prestigious jobs. The number of people gunning for these elite schools and employers is rising much faster than the number of available slots. That’s partially why schooling and urban housing prices are rising so fast.

2. [Optimistic Nihilism](https://tinyclouds.org/optimistic_nihilism) - So much in here that I never considered. I don't agree with this philosophy, but there's truths to it I cannot deny. Well worth a read.

> If we somehow pack a ship with humans and supplies and travel at that speed towards the nearest star, it would take more than 30,000 years. 30k years might as well be a billion; when compared to our 100 year lives, both are infinite.

3. [Tasks, lists, and promises](http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/05/19/priority/) - First, I love this blog. I stumbled across it a few weeks ago and bookmarked damn near every article. Second, I will be re-reading this one. Such a simple and sane way to tackle projects in here. I'm taking notes.

> This system of doing things made me happy because it didn't leave us holding a bag full of promises. Just talking about something didn't commit us to spending time on it later. By disconnecting the talk from the commitment, this gave us the freedom to talk about all kinds of stuff without worry of somehow ending up with tons of stupid and useless items down the road.

4. [Why you should join pinecone](https://getmatter.com/email/9186836/?token=9186836%3APXCjbrbuICXFhp8dRTeT7pL7wRc) - I'm impressed by these folks. This article came out last year, a full 6 months before the AI craze. They read the road and did a deep dive on what became on of the more important companies in the space. Wanna learn about AI? Start here.

> Fundamentally, AI operates by transforming unstructured data (images, text, video) into structured data - specifically, long lists of numbers called vectors.

5. [Walk with one of L.A.'s top foragers as he picks his meal on the mountainside](https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-foraging-pascal-baudar-20160305-story.html) - I discovered foraging while living on a mountain in Oregon. The fact you could find food, lots of it and good, out in the wild blew my mind. I feasted on blackberries and apples and pears. In LA, I struggled to find the same. Turns it there is more than I imaged.

> “My passion since 1999 has been to discover the flavor of California,” said Baudar, summing up both that day’s path through the local forest and many of the more ambitious newer restaurants in Los Angeles. “What if you could create a real California cuisine? And I’m not talking farmers markets.”

## Books I'm Reading

1. Skull Water by Heinz Insu Fenkl - I’ve only read the introduction so far but I’m already hooked. A quasi autobiographical novel about Korea post Vietnam War is so up my alley it’s not even funny.
2. F*ck Love by Michael & Sarah Bennett - I am learning so much it’s not even funny here. How I didn’t know some of this blows my mind. But anyone dating right now needs to read this. It’ll either save you from painful relationships or at least show you why you keep running to them.
3. The Secret History by Donna Tartt - I took a break from this one this week. Excited to get back to it on my plane back ride from the frigid place that Phoenix is.

### Products of the Week

1. [Clipdrop](https://clipdrop.co/stable-doodle?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) - My jaw dropped when I first tried this out. Shit like this makes me feel like are living in the future. I will never lose at Pictionary again.

2. [Mind Window](https://mindwindowapp.com/) - I've been using the [How We Feel App](https://howwefeel.org/) to track my feelings for a while now. I enjoy it, but I'm always looking for new tools so this one is now on the list!
3. [Project E Ink](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/project-e-ink) - I love the idea of interactive low light devices. They save your eyes and just look incredible. This is one of my favorite finds yet.
4. [SpeakAI](https://speakai.cc/) - I'm not sure if this one is ready for the prime time yet, but it's a fascinating stab at language learning. For me, the most difficult thing is learning the conversational flow. While this isn't perfect, it's a step up from rote memorization or expensive one on one conversations.
5. [AWS Docs GPT](https://www.awsdocsgpt.com/?ck_subscriber_id=1987383695) - If I know anything about Amazon, it’s that their obsession with the customer does not extend to their design or communication chops. Thank goodness for tools like this to sift through the madness.

## Idea of the Week: The Power of Place

Part of the reason I love to travel is to see how powerful places are. One of my dearly held principles is that power is not inherently bad, but dangerous. Great power is not a curse, but a burden. The same power that gives good can bring evil.

Every place exerts a powerful and thus dangerous pull. Los Angeles is powerful for the fame and fortune concentrated in it. I'm in Phoenix this week and experiencing a new kind of power: heat.

The same heat that brings people here from the cold north comes with great danger. Climate change is exacerbating the changes, but to some degree Phoenix always held power like this. You see the influence of this power everywhere. In the architecture, in the habits of the people, in the food.

It's the etches this power draws in the culture of a place that fascinates me.

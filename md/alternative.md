# The Problem with “Alternative” Investments

A few years back I got caught up in the idea of alternative investments. I read the Black Swan and a few other investing books. I started to imagine how I could generate returns in excess of the stock market. Could I catch details others missed?

I went far down that path. I tried out products like Masterworks, Fundrise, and Coinbase. I didn’t put much money in any of those, but I did experiment. Over time, I’ve pulled back on all my “alternative” investments, excepting one, which I’ll cover later.

In my experience, there are 2 key problems with alternative investments:

- They don’t beat the market
- They are high fee

I spent tons of time trying to find ways to beat the market. My conclusion is you can beat the market if you are good with options. I’m not good with options and I don’t have enough cash on hand to play around with them. Any other attempt to beat the market is not sustainable.

Well, with the exception of a single strategy: buy and hold specific companies. I’ve seen that work over long time horizons but it’s risky and I don’t love risk. The “best” and easiest strategy I’ve found is to use low cost index funds.

The challenge with alternative investments is that few things can beat the market. Hedge funds rarely do it. The problem is not that alternative investments suck, it’s more that they are competing against an unfair opponent.

The core problem they struggle to overcome is their correlation with the market. Most alternative investments ride the highs and lows of the market. In the short term, they might outperform the “market.” But since they are correlated with the market, it’s not likely they will provide crazy outsized returns.

To truly beat the market, you need to be able to move in the opposite direction of the market. You need to benefit from down and up swings alike. That’s where options come in, but those are risky and I don’t understand them.

The “pick stocks and stick” with them strategy can work because indices include big losers as well as big winners. 7 companies are driving the bulk of the S&P 500’s recent gains. If you own those 7 companies (or even one of them), you are doing much better than the market. Great strategy in boom times, risky in bust times.

Back to alternative investments. The real kicker here is the fees. Platforms like Masterworks take tons of fees. Let’s say your alternative investment platform takes 2% of your gains (or worse, 1% of Assets Under Management AUM). Index funds from Vanguard charge less than 0.1%, 20X less. To beat an index fund, your investment platform needs to outperform an index fund by ~2%.

When the market is up on a good year 10%, you are talking about outperforming index funds by a minimum of 20%. That’s hard as hell. Once again, I’m not say that alternate investments suck. I’m just saying the cards are stacked against their usefulness.

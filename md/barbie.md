# A Few Thoughts on the Barbie Movie

Last weekend I broke the seal on the Barbie movie and watched it not once, but twice. Since then, I've been trying to make sense of it and come up with an original take. Talking with a friend last night, I finally found that take.

My focus in reflecting on Barbie is adjacent to the main stars. Barbie and Ken are fascinating in their own right and much ink is spilled about them. My focus is on an under-appreciated, yet significant role played by Will Ferrell.

Thanks to Scott Galloway, Liz Plank, and many others, my interest in creating a healthier masculinity is growing day by day. Ken presents an interesting set of commentary on modern masculinity, but it's Will Ferrell's role that I find more compelling.

Ken's role begins pathetic, shifts to dangerous, and comes back to enlightened. There's real power to naming that arc and exposing it. The entitlement, insecurity, and obsessions of men are worth investigating and healing. Ken is full of the hard edges that make this story recognizable and problematic.

Will Ferrell's character is a different animal. He is portrayed as childish, yet powerful. Kara Swisher talks about our culture's simultaneous deification and coddling of men like this. Silicon Valley is full of men who deny their power, hiding behind the adult's in the room.

Ken's trope is more obvious and it's easier to see danger there. The Andrew Tate's of the world are a real threat. But as Lil Wayne says, real g's move in silence. The covert nature of the Will Ferrell's of the world means their impact is underestimated.

To my mind, that makes them the more dangerous and difficult group. Treating a disease no one believes in is an impossible task. The pattern that I see here is the denial of power. It is a paradox, as it is strange to assert that those who deny power can be as dangerous as those who grasp it.

Yet when we think about the movie as a whole, we start to realize that it is Will Ferrell's character who creates all the problems. Ken is a symptom. The decisions made by a powerful CEO who denies his own power are pulling the strings all along.

There are tongue in cheek references to this throughout, but I missed it on the first watch through. I locked in on the primary story lines, missing the background bass that drove the movie.

The CEO's abdication of his power and his simultaneous exercise of it to maintain his position is a sleight of hand trick worth applause. We miss the real culprit as he hides beneath his childish ways.

Moving away from the Barbie movie, we are seeing this play out live with Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Two powerful men who pretend to be victims at various times. Zuckerberg is clever enough to pair himself with Elon to look favorable. Yet there is no denying he uses many of the same tactics as Elon.

They both mastered the art of appearing less powerful than they are. Zuckerberg's golden era of the trick came during the Cambridge Analytics scandal. He did not know what was going on. His ignorance continues as folks like Jonathan Haidt point out the nefarious impact of Instagram on our children. Zuckerberg is conveniently naive, stuck on the "power of connection" and the metaverse.

Musk, as much as I dislike him, is playing the game at another level. He is able to project contradictory images. First, he's a genius playing 3D chess while others play checkers. Second, he's a man child reposting baseless conspiracy theories. The holding of these two identities in tension is as difficult to manage as it is intentional.

Those who could hold Elon accountable view him as a child, dumb but harmless. Those who can empower him view his genius. Through sleight of hand he appears more powerful to his allies and less threatening to his enemies. It is a frightening playbook to run.

It's effective and the Barbie movie lays it out for us. What do we do here? Kara Swisher is right when she says we need to keep in mind these are adults with real power. Just because they act childish, does not mean they are not to be held accountable.

Elon Musk is a father, a CEO, and over 50. It's time he started acting his age. He is not a victim, he is an actor, in all senses of the word. Watching a man roller skate into Barbie world is funny. Watching a man holding the keys to a war joke about cage matches is not.

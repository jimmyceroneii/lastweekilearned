# Why I Listen to Songs on Repeat While I Write

In Deep Work, Cal Newport talks about startup and shut down rituals. One of my startup rituals for writing is to turn on some music. I hear differing takes on music all the time. Some argue it hinders focus and in many cases, I find that's true.

Even given the chance it lowers my focus, I keep music on. I love music, I grew up around it. My dad worked in radio and moonlight as a DJ on the side. The earliest pictures of me are next to a speaker, smile wide and spindly legs in motion.

I've been stuck with the dilemma here for a while, loving music yet recognizing the pull on my attention. On accident, I found a neat solution, at least for when I'm writing. I pick a single song and listen to it on repeat while I write.

There's a few gems here. First, by forcing myself to choose a single song, I choose one I know I love. Much of the distraction that comes with music is figuring out whether I like what I'm listening to. Picking a single song eliminates the shuffle. My mind knows it is not in music exploration mode, it's in writing mode.

Second, there is no skipping. I am not making any music related decisions while I write. At the most, I'm enjoying a song I love. At the worst, the song fades into the background as it repeats over and over again.

Today's song is Anyway by Noah Kahan. Noah is a favorite background music artist for me. I use Carlo's Song from him often as well. For some reason, almost all the songs I choose for my repeat sessions are sad, slow and calm. I cannot seem to find any words in me while listening to Youngboy NBA.

As I cement the practice of listening to a single song on repeat, I'm starting to incorporate the songs into my articles. I forget to do it most often, but I'm more and more trying to add a producer tag of sorts in the form of a song. I'm undecided about whether to put it at the start or the end of an article.

My hope is that me (and others) can listen to the song while reading it for a kind of wine pairing situation. Probably a pipe dream but a fun one to imagine. Multi-media writing!

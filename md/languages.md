# Experiments in Language Acquisition

## Background

At the moment I speak English fluently and Spanish passably. I started learning Spanish in the 8th grade with what my friend and I called, “American Spanish.” The class was a joke and I treated language acquisition that way for a long time. Sometime in my sophomore year of high school, Spanish became a lifeline. I swam for hours a day and to keep myself entertained, I would try to think in Spanish.

Thinking became changing the language of my phone to Spanish, reading the news in Spanish and more. I became a man possessed, soaking myself in the language to escape my small town. Until college though, my love affair with Spanish remained one sided. I “spoke” Spanish but mostly with myself and my diary.

In college my education moved away from the academic and into the social. My friends taught me how Spanish is actually spoken and I did my best to adapt my classroom learning to the real world. After college came a Spanish drought as the Pandemic kept me locked inside. Moving to Los Angeles reignited the spark and I now use the language almost daily.

## Takeaways

Unfortunately my acquisition of Spanish is not something I’m able to replicate for future languages. First, it took more than 10 years. Second, it involved formal schooling, which admittedly did little. Third, Spanish is a unique language in America. It’s easy to use it daily almost anywhere in the country. Not all languages are as omnipresent.

Thus, I need something of a new approach for language acquisition. So far, the most interesting approaches come from Tim Ferris, even as I don’t mention him later in this article. His book, The 4 Hour Chef, presents surprising lessons as [does his article](https://tim.blog/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/) about the topic. I have yet to dive into his work, even as I admire it, so I omit it later.

## Potential Approaches

#### Start with Scripts

My unproven theory here is that literacy goes a long way towards helping language acquisition. Learning letters is comparatively easy (excepting complex scripts like Japanese and Mandarin) to learning a language. More importantly, my thesis is that learning scripts is more durable than learning to speak. There’s less to forget, it involves [multiple representations](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.19-11-0253), and it is easy to practice alone.

One pillar of my theory of language acquisition is that I can learn many of the worlds scripts. I can learn them while learning other languages. Thus I can parallelize some of the work of learning a language. Practically this means that while I’m learning to speak Italian, I can be learning the script for Arabic. Then when it comes time to learn Arabic, I’ve already got a head start.

So far I’m using a mix of Duolingo and the [Script Hacking book series](https://www.alibris.com/booksearch?mtype=B&keyword=script+hacking&hs.x=0&hs.y=0) to pick up scripts. Duolingo is surprisingly helpful for learning scripts as it's interactive. That said, it lacks context like all Duolingo lessons do. So you miss out on the nuances of a script (like the fact Riuel is both R and L in Korean).

#### Technological Immersion

I’ve yet to try this approach in earnest outside of my early attempts with changing the language of my phone. But many of my multilingual friends learned English by watching Netflix. Thanks to technology, we can take this approach to extremes. In theory you could turn everything technological into another language, transforming your digital world into a learning space. It’s a little trial by fire but it’s effective, if not efficient.

The advent of AI takes this further. We can converse online with AI Chatbots. I had a surprisingly enjoyable conversation with [Claude](https://claude.ai/login) in Spanish earlier today. Claude is a general purpose Chatbot but below I list out some more specific "AI" language tools:

I’ve yet to give any of these a real college try. But if you have, please let me know how they work. For now I’m sticking with Duolingo, even as I find it ineffective for anything outside of vocabulary.

#### Old Fashioned Approaches

In addition to the above, which are a little more novel, there are tried and true approaches. You can take a class, travel to a new place, or hire a tutor. I would also put most language apps in the “old fashioned” bucket. Most are digital versions of a class, where you memorize rules mindlessly. Some are getting better, but at their heart they are all forms of memorization.

### A Coda on Computer Science Languages

An interesting connection here is that being multilingual is quite common in the world of software. I’ve got a passing knowledge of 3-4 software languages. Perhaps more interesting than the sheer number of programming languages one can know is the attitude towards learning new ones. It’s seen as part of the trade and not terribly overwhelming. It’s perfectly reasonable to learn a new one in a month.

Further, it’s perfectly ok to be passable without shame. There is a strange focus on becoming “native” in language acquisition. I see it as a hindrance to practicing and it does not exist in the world of software. It’s normal to suck at a language and learn languages pragmatically.

I’ll need to do more thinking here, but I think there’s some richness to be had in terms of novel approaches from programming language acquisition.

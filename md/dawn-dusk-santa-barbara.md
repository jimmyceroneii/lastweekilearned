# Dawn & Dusk Santa Barbara

It's the little things that draw me in to anything or anyone. In the case of my friend Neil, it was his habit of letting silence hang before dropping an insight I couldn't imagine finding myself. In the case of Los Angeles, the languages floating through the air get me every time.

As I sit here in Dawn & Dusk in Santa Barbara, it's a cacophony of little things that are doing it for me. The first thing to catch my eye are huge, wide linen cushions. The color is just right, a dusty tan. The sturdy wooden chairs at the elevated bar table deal keep the vibe going.

Everything seems well chosen, intentional. The woods are soft and gentle. The walls are dark grey or concrete. Splashes of color bring life to the space. My favorite features so far is candles tucked into square slots in the bar wall. Their wax drips down the wall in a fascinating touch I've never seen or imagined.

Even the music is lovely. Almost without fail the first thing to come out of my backpack at a coffee shop are my AirPods. Here they remain tucked away, likely upset at the snub.

Beyond all the physical touches though is the concept itself. The name kills me. It's so simple and clever, incredible branding. Dawn is the coffee shop. Dusk is the bar. Both coexist in a continuous flow yet both are distinctive. I've yet to see this pulled off.

There are plenty of places that acknowledge seasonality, which I love. Few are able to match the rhythm of the day. I love the idea of coming here in the morning for my coffee and returning for a drink in the evening. There's something grounding about a ritual like that.

In one of my favorite shows of all time, Hometown Cha Cha Cha, there's a place called Coffee in the Morning and Beer at Night. The name is goofy but the concept is sound and it is a delight to see it executed well here in Santa Barbara.

Ah before I dive into other things, I must note the coffee is passable. I'm no coffee expert so it is likely better than I give it credit for. But to me heathen brain, coffee is coffee and this is as good as any I've had. No complaints!

Ok I meant to end it there, but I just saw a couple walk out as if they were leaving a hotel and realized this is also a hotel. My god this places grows on me yet more. I cannot imagine a better spot to stay. Right in the heart of downtown, probably near the beach (which I have yet to find). Good stuff.

## Notes on Santa Barbara in General

My primary interest in Santa Barbara is that it's the setting of my other favorite show, Psych. I love the show and it is such a thrill to see the architecture of the show come alive. It caught me by surprise because at first, I didn't recognize it. Then all at once it came to me. The white washed walls and the terra cotta roofs seemed to coalesce into the background of the show I loved all at once.

I came here at random, even as I've long wanted to come here. My original plans for labor day weekend included a long hike at Yosemite (or somewhere like it). After hearing from Neil it would be a zoo, I downgraded my plans to a local hike (maybe Big Bear?). Then I became obsessed with the idea of piloting car camping.

A few months ago, I became the proud owner of a VW Golf Alltrack. The Alltrack is a stretched out version of the more familiar VW Golf. It feels long and it can store just about anything. So for months, I've been wondering if it would store me in the back for a night.

So last night I drove my way up to Santa Barbara, sleeping back and yoga mat in tow. First, I found out Santa Barbara is home to generous parking arrangements. I parked overnight (for free) and I can leave my car until 10:30 AM (for free). Second, I learned my car is not the ideal sleeping spot.

The start of the problem is I don't quite fit. I kind of fit. But not all the way. I'm 6'4" so I asked a lot of my Alltrack to fit my entirety back there. The rest of the problem is gear related. I learned that a yoga mat does not equal a sleeping pad. If I'm going to try this again, I need a real sleeping pad.

My yoga mat did little to cushion my bony limbs. Further, I learned the value of pillows. I, like a fool, brought along a blanket as a pillow. Turns out pillows are kind of huge and a blanket cannot handle the job.

Given the shit night of sleep I got, I'm not eager to retry car camping in the near future. But, I do think I can make it a much better experience next time around.

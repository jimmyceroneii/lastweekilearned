# On the Importance of Counterfactuals in Technical Documentation

#### The Argument Against Documentation

As you know, I think of learning as a map. If learning is map making, most technical documentation is a napkin sketch. Technical documentation is an afterthought at most companies, if it exists at all. At most companies, people say things like, "self documenting code." As if reading code should tell you everything you need to know about a project.

I nodded my head along with that sentiment for a long time, all the while feeling off about it. I could not put my finger on the error of their ways. Nor could I explain my behavior. Even as I heard all about the uselessness of documentation, I wrote reams of it. Documentation poured out of me like a leaky faucet.

The more I wrote, the more I needed to explain myself to coworkers. They would wisely ask me about the point of all these words. Why write when it goes out of date? Why write when the code tells the story just fine?

#### Documentation Maximalism: Documentation as Learning

My coworker is a documentation minimalist, arguing that it is a form of tech debt. If documentation is about providing guidelines and recipes, I could not agree more. What I finally realized is that my motivation for documentation differs.

Why? Because at my core, I'm more writer than software engineer. I came to software late and unwillingly. I've never given up my liberal arts background, no matter how technical I become.

For me, writing is a form of learning. Any and all documentation is valuable because it forces the author to understand the system they document. Nothing brings clarity like putting the pen to the page. When we write, we see problems and come up with stories to describe our work.

#### The Special Power of Counterfactuals

There is a certain kind of writing that is extra valuable: counterfactuals. A counterfactual is a concept from history which means an unrealized possibility. Japan becoming a US state is an example of a counterfactual. It almost happened, but it did not. A counterfactual is about the choices that fell by the wayside along our journey.

The most valuable information in documentation is the counterfactuals. To understand a system, you need to understand the paths not taken. Knowing that you chose Red Panda over Apache Kafka tells you critical information about the requirements and the problems your system solves.

Most documentation reads like a timeline. Great documentation reads more like a map. The paths not taken clearly marked and explained. Do your future self a favor, make good maps.

# Why I Batch My Communication

Before I start in earnest here, I want to acknowledge that my strategy is far from perfect and a work in progress. It is not fool proof, in that some messages require instant communication. With those caveats out of the way, here's what I do.

For almost all of my communication, I use the Getting Things Done method of clearing the inbox once a week. The system is supposed to be setup for to dos and tasks, but I've coopted it for my various forms of communication. The idea is that you evaluate things all at once on a set cadence rather than constantly responding to what comes through your door (or ignoring half of it). You capture everything and sort it later.

Why do I do this? I find texting and communication in general to be taxing. I'm a severe introvert wearing an extrovert's clothes. My curiosity and active mind pull me out into the world more than my sensitive soul can handle. Further, I'm easily distractible and sensitive to interruption. If I don't manage my communications carefully, I end up frazzled and tired all week long.

A wrinkle here is that I love to communicate. In the right amount, I find it stimulating for the mind and soul. I love my friends and I love meeting new people. So I needed a system that allowed me to keep in touch consistently without wearing myself out.

All right I've beat around the bush long enough. My system is simple. Once a week on the weekend (usually Saturday or Sunday), I process all the communications of the week.

If a text is not urgent, I leave it unread. All emails (outside of same week scheduling) are saved for later. Whatsapp, Marco Polo and anything else get the same treatment. I store them all up.

One important note is communicating this system with others. When I meet someone for the first time, I let them know what I do so that my delays are expected and clear.

Then on the weekend, I sit down at my laptop and crank through them all. Everything I can possibly do on my computer, I do on my computer. I am a fast typer (80 wpm) and it makes a huge difference. When I'm replying to 50+ messages from the week, it's the little things like that which make a huge difference.

So far, the system works. It's tiring to do everything in one day. But it means I can communicate with more people than I might otherwise without interrupting my focus and draining my energy throughout the week.

The biggest hook so far is deciding which messages require instant responses. I do find myself drained throughout the week seeing messages build up. My stress builds with them. My first attempt at solving this has been to clear my notifications so they don't build up.

My next attempt will be hiding my phone during the work day. I check it too often, waiting for messages I won't respond to. If hiding my phone doesn't work, I might try checking my messages twice a week (Wednesday and Weekend). We shall see!

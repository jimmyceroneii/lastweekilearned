# The Social Nature of Politics

In the podcast I said, "Politics is more about sales and alliances than it is particular policies or beliefs." Just after that, I said I would give the idea more thought. Here I am with a little bit more thought.

I'm surprised I missed this idea before. Now that I'm thinking it, I can't unsee it. Politics is social. What do I mean by that?

The same dynamics we see on the playground take place at a larger scale at Washington. Some people are cool, some are not. Some build respect, others are bullies. That's an oversimplification, of course, but it goes farther than one might think.

What I find more interesting than the framing though is the impact of the mental model. For the longest time, my mental model of politics (and religion for that matter) rested on the bedrock of logic. If you laid out an argument well enough, people couldn't help but come around.

Reading the Righteous Mind disabused me of the lofty ideals of human logic. I started to understand humans not as logical actors, but emotional ones. Yet I see now that I didn't take the thinking far enough. The pieces were there. I'd read Switch by Dan and Chip Heath and learned about the complex dance that is change.

Their description of change (as well as Nudge) should have been the push I needed. Yet still I didn't see it. I still looked at change and politics as systems. And to some degree they are. But they are a particular kind of system, a social system.

Why does it matter if it's a social system? You handle a social system differently than any other system. A poor Accounting system can be fixed with Excel. A poor social system requires a different touch.

Ezra Klein identified a since snuffed out bright spot in Why We're Polarized. Back in the day, Congress lived in Washington DC. No matter their differences, they lived as neighbors. Proximity is a powerful social tool. Used well, it drives affinity that otherwise would never grow.

In a misguided attempt to make Congress more responsive, we began to emphasize time spent with their constituents. A noble goal with a nefarious impact. Klein's thesis (and my own) is that by ending their weak social ties, we created a more polarized political landscape in America.

What this suggests to me is that change may not be as difficult as we expect it to be. One of the core tenants of Chaos Theory and Complex Systems is that little changes can impact the system in asymmetric ways. The reintroduction of wolves to certain National Parks changed the ecosystem in myriad and unexpected ways.

I believe seeing our political system as a social one leads us to some unexpected conclusions. The solution to our political malaise could be as simple as encouraging friendship across the aisle. Not agreement, not assent, but simple friendship.

It seems trite, but our political progress is better measured by the number of casual conversations between Elizabeth Warren and Mitch McConnell than anything else. When we are dealing with complex systems, symptoms are difficult to treat. Direct treatment rarely responds. We must find the unexpected levers that move everything.

Seeing politics as political makes some problems seem more trivial and others more concerning. The growing income inequality in our country goes from a minor annoyance to an incredible threat, probably the most serious we face. Income gaps mean social gaps. And since politics is social, that means political gaps.

The problems we appear to face are in fact symptoms of causes we ignore. I've yet to give income inequality sustained thought. After writing this, I will. I'll let you know what I come up with.

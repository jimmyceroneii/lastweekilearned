# Beyond Opinions: Channeling Curiosity into Meaningful Action

I am tired of trying to have takes on celebrities of all kinds. I’m tired of hearing about private details I don’t want to nor should know. I am tired of attempting to understand global conflict for which I lack context.

There is something about being alive today that makes us believe we know more than we do. I’m guilty of it. Since I read the news, I assume I know about global politics. More and more, I’m coming to the conclusion that I don’t know. The world is complex and vast.

There is so much I don’t know. I used to pride myself on my takes about the world and what happens in it. Now I look back at myself and see my pride. Who am I to say? I want to have less takes and take more action.

## Less Takes = More Actions

My gut reaction to this is that I’m giving up. In saying less, I am waving my hands at all the complexity and letting go. I’m disengaging. Yet I’m not sure it needs to be that black and white. I can learn with curiosity without coming up with a “take.” There’s this idea that I need to form an opinion to take action.

I no longer think that is the case. I do not need to have a “take” on Russia Ukraine to rush a donation to the Red Cross. I’m not an expert on the politics of that region, but any fool can see that folks are suffering. I don’t need to pretend to know what I’m talking about to offer help.

I wrote about a slush fund for donations to emergencies last month. My tentative process is to review where to donate once a week. Right now I watch the news to feel smart. My goal is that the slush fund gives purpose to my mindless news consumption. Instead of looking for a “take,” I can ask, “How can I help here?”

I so want to adopt this attitude because I’m tired of feeling powerless as I read the news. It is exhausting to read about the world crumbling. Knowing a lot about a global crisis is worthless. There is real power to curiosity, but curiosity leads to action. I want to read less news yet do more about the little I read.

## Not Both Sides

There is real danger here of drifting into the false equivalency of “both sides.” I want to be clear that saying you don’t know is not the same as saying both sides are equally culpable. It is clear that Russia is in the wrong for invading a sovereign nation unprovoked. I will take clear stances when there is wrong done in the world.

But I will no longer dwell on trying to find an “interesting” take on the conflict. I’m not going to sift through intel in hopes of sounding intelligent. I’m shifting my focus from finding a take to taking action. In the process, I don’t need to know as much.

It’s surprising, but the bar of knowledge for offering help is low. You just move towards the suffering. You do not need to be fancy and you don’t need to act like a know it all. You only need to know enough.

Before I sign off here, I want to acknowledge my philosophy is full of holes I’m unaware of. That said, I’m confident it is better than my previous philosophy. If you see holes, please let me know so I can find my next, better philosophy.

# Why I Love the Rain

My only complaint about Los Angeles weather is the lack of rain. Some folks hate the rain. I can understand their perspective. Rain is annoying and dreary and cold.

I love the rain though. I'm a hyperactive person driven by guilt. Rain gives me an excuse to slow down and take a break. Should I learn to give myself a break? Yep. Does rain do the trick for now? Yep.

One of the challenges I encountered living through a winter in Los Angeles was the lack of a break. In the Midwest, winter is a time of enforced slowing down. The cold, the snow, and the short daylight make it impossible to do all you do in the summer. It is enforced hibernation.

Out here it is a different story. The winter is perfect weather in my book. Temperatures rarely climb above 75 or below 60. God must winter in Southern California because the weather here is heavenly.

Yet it does not give me the break I'm used to. I suppose what I'm writing about then is using the weather to modulate your moods. There's a real mind-over-matter strain out there in the world. If you think it, you can do it.

I don't buy it. When it rains, it changes how I interact with the world. When there is no winter, my life is different. The rhythms are different. I love how aloof we humans make ourselves appear. We act unaffected by the world around us as if we can shape reality.

In Walter Isaacson's book about Steve Jobs, he talks about Jobs' reality distortion field. Jobs could speak things into existence out of sheer will. Not all of us are Steve Jobs and not all of Steve Jobs' desires came into being. We are limited as human beings, that is part of the deal.

I love the rain because it limits me. The rain does what I cannot: slow me down. While it's true I should be able to slow down on my own, that's not yet reality. I'm working on it, my reality distortion field is saying things like, "You can take PTO." A little less ambitious than Steve Jobs but I'll take what I can get.

Until then though, I will celebrate the rain as everyone else grumbles.

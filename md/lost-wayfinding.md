# Getting Lost as a Form of Wayfinding

I grew up a chronic lost boy. Not the Neverland kind, the "I never know where I am in space." Drop me in a forest or a city and I might never find my way home. As I got older and started driving, I found a surprising way to find my way: lose it.

I would take wrong turns on the way home from school, challenging myself to find the way back without maps. After enough of this, I knew my way around by feel. The lost boy found his way.

I used the same strategy as I moved all over the place, from Colorado to Michigan to Oregon and finally, to Los Angeles. Yet with time, I realized getting lost is the wrong way to put it.

Getting lost is an unplanned departure from your desired destination. What I did was spontaneous, yes, but not unplanned. I was wandering. I love to wander. It's all the excitement of being lost with none of the stress.

#### Wandering and Exploration

Before I dive more into wandering, I want to explore the difference between wandering and exploration. Wandering is softer, in my mind. Exploration comes with an intensity to it. A wanderer and an explorer are different people. One appears lost, aimless. The other appears brave, strong.

Yet I suspect the wanderer finds more along the way. The intensity of the explorer, while useful in pursuing a goal, makes one narrow minded. The friends I have who wander always know a place in a different way than my friends that "explore."

Exploration is in many ways about finding the best. You want to discover the highlights, something new and significant. Wandering has no such aims. The only goal is to see. There's no judgement in a wanderer.

#### Wandering as Wayfinding

I find it sad how rare my wandering is. In my college days, I wandered freely. With no responsibilities, my life could drift around. Now that I'm single again, the wandering is coming back. Part of the secret to my wandering these days is radical earliness. On the [Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Yldd8VvLO5GjIsFd78gnA?si=0aa91a7197ee4fdb), Simon Coronoel talked about his principle and I loved it.

Everywhere he goes, he's at least an hour early. That time is free. And it's the perfect time to wander. So more and more I'm showing up stupid early and wandering. I'm finding it freeing and fun - give it a try and let me know what you think!

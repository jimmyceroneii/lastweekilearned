# Some Thoughts on Charity

## Investing and Charity

Investing is not about making great stock picks. That is luck. Good investing is all about a system. I hesitate to compare investing and charity, yet here I go. Charity is an investment in human capital. I’m not on board with effective altruism though I can’t disagree with effective charity.

In the past, my charitable contributions and volunteer work remained scatterbrained and random. Earnest, yes. Effective, uncertain. As I get my feet back under me after a season of change, I’m reviewing how I approach charity with fresh eyes.

I’m wrong here, but I’ve yet to find an area of life that doesn’t love a system. The simplest systems are rules of thumb for guiding decisions. I do not want my system to be devoid of emotion. I want my deepest-held priorities reflected in my giving. My goal here is to better align with myself, not remove the “emotions” from my giving. That said, I’m still trying to be smart here.

One upgrade I’m looking to make relates to overhead. Charity is best given to people in need, not administrations. I make exceptions here for charities I know personally.

One misconception I hold about giving is that small amounts don’t matter. The Bill Gates Foundation needs a system for giving, but not someone tiny like me. There is truth in my attitude. There are few consequences if I mismanage my miniature giving budget.

I’m creating a system for giving more to simplify my life and decisions than to create an outsized impact. When I find myself frequently in debates with myself, I make a system. More and more, I’m finding myself struggling with decisions about giving.

There are two categories of decisions here:

- Long term initiatives
- Emergency short-term giving

## Long-Term Initiatives

I’m struggling to focus on long-term initiatives. I don’t know what matters most to me and where to put my scarce resources. I see a lot of causes I would love to support every day. Lacking priorities, I  agonize over whether to support a new cause.

I want to clarify for myself which long-term initiatives matter. Then I want to set up a system to revisit these priorities consistently. Moving to this flow allows me to check new giving opportunities with ease. I’ve got a simple rule and a way to revisit it.

When I consider long-term projects, many causes come to mind, which is great! The problem is I struggle to sort these projects into cohesive categories. In the past, I’ve given to RAINN, the Red Cross, ACTS Holland, and more. So far I find myself giving to education, disaster relief, and food security. I want to expand my giving to include environmental protection.

My process will start with listing out all possible charities. I will filter my list using Charity Navigator, which grades charities based on impact. Then I’ll group them together and rank them.

## Short Term Initiatives

This category is tougher as it is unpredictable. I want to cover a couple of things here:

- Slush Fund to handle humanitarian crises
- Cash Fund for local charity

Short-term initiatives are pop-ups. I’m thinking of the flooding in India or the earthquake in Turkey. Global, urgent catastrophes. On a more local level, I look at buying meals for folks or offering cash assistance at random.

A “slush” fund, where I withhold an unassigned chunk of money, would make sense. The decision-making is easier here. I give until I’m out for the month. Whatever I don’t spend rolls over to the next month.

Using these simple heuristics makes charged decisions simple. It lets me give without fear and then stop without guilt. I’m confident in the “slush” fund side of this idea, but I’m less confident about the cash fund.

I’m loath to carry cash and rarely find myself at an ATM. If folks have suggestions for how to set up a cash “slush” fund please reach out. I would love to hear about your practices for charity and how you identified causes to support. My tentative solution is to get cash back when I buy groceries which is working well.

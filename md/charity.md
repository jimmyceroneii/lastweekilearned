# Some Thoughts on Charity

One of my favorite insights from a financial newsletter I follow is that investing is not about making great stock picks. That is called luck. Good investing all about a system.

I’m wrong here, but I’ve yet to find an area of life which doesn’t benefit from a system. The simplest systems are principles, rules of thumb for guiding decisions. In the past, my interaction with charity felt haphazard. Thanks to planning for a wedding, money got tight and I shut down most of my giving.

Without a wedding (long story), I’m looking to restart my giving. I want to me more principled in my approach this time around. An important note here is that I do not want my system to be devoid of emotion.

I’m not a huge fan of the effective altruism movement. I don’t think we can or should take the emotion out of giving. I want my deepest held priorities to be reflected in my giving.

I want my system to support my most heartfelt causes. My goal here is to better align with myself, not remove the “emotions” from my giving. That said, I’m still trying to be smart here.

One “logical” stipulation I’m looking to include in my philosophy of giving is to look into the amount of money given to charity that goes to help people vs what goes to overhead. I make exceptions here for charities I know personally.

When I’m giving to a giant charity though, I do care about efficiency. At scale, the amount of dollars going to help counts.

I think one misconception folks hold about giving is that small amounts don’t matter. The Bill Gates Foundation needs a system for giving, but not someone tiny like me. To be honest, folks are right. Small amounts don’t move the needle and there’s few consequences if I mismanage my tiny giving budget.

The reason I’m creating a system for giving is to simplify my life and decisions, both now and going forward. When I find myself frequently in debates with myself, I make a system. More and more, I’m finding myself struggling with decisions about giving.

There’s two categories of decisions here:

- Long term initiatives
- Emergency short term giving

## Long Term Initiatives

I’m struggling to prioritize long term initiatives. I don’t know what matters most to me and where to allocate my scarce resources. I see a lot of causes I would love to support every day. Without knowing my priorities, I end up agonizing over whether to support a new cause.

I want to clarify for myself which long term initiatives matter. Then I want to setup a system to revisit these priorities on a consistent basis (monthly, quarterly) so I can batch the decisions. Moving to this flow allows me to evaluate new giving opportunities (no for now to all, review all once a quarter) with ease. I’ve got a simple rule and a way to revisit it.

When I think about long term initiatives, a ton of causes pop to mind: Red Cross, RAINN, Save the Children, Give Direct, etc. I am struggling to even categorize these long term initiatives. In the past, I’ve given to RAINN, the Red Cross, ACTS Holland and more. Typically I find myself giving to education, disaster relief, and food security. I want to expand my giving to include environmental protection.

I think my process here is going to be listing out all possible charities, group them together, prioritize them based on my budget, and go from there. I want to evaluate all these charities with Charity Navigator as I’ll be donating long term here.

## Short Term Initiatives

This category is tougher as it’s kind of random. I want to setup a couple of things here:

- Slush Fund to handle humanitarian crises
- Cash Fund for local charity

Short term initiatives are pop ups. I’m thinking of the flooding in India occurring right now or the earthquake in Turkey. That’s global stuff. On a more local level, I’m thinking of buying meals for folks or offering cash assistance to the homeless.

In both cases, I think a “slush” fund of sorts, where I’ve got a set amount of money set aside for each month would make sense. The decision making is easier here. I give until I’m out for the month. Whatever I don’t spend rolls over to the next month.

Using these simple heuristics makes emotionally charged decisions simple. It lets me give without fear and then stop without guilt. I’m confident in the “slush” fund side of this idea, but I’m less confident about the cash fund.

I’m loath to carry cash and rarely find myself at an ATM. If folks have suggestions for how to setup a cash “slush” fund please reach out. I would love to hear about your practices for charity and how you identified causes to support.

# Writing Again

It’s been a few years since I’ve written as much as I have in the last month. The last few years, excepting a 90 day stretch I’ll get to in a moment, felt like a drip from a spigot left on during a cold winter. The words would careen their way through aching pipes, plopping out in big, random globs.

Now it feels like a summer day where someone left the hose on. The words just keep flowing. It’s funny how when you get in the habit of writing, you write more than you mean to. I only ask myself to write [750 words a day](https://750words.com/).

Back when I wrote less, every word felt like a chore. Now that I write more, I often write 750 only to come back later in the day for more. I felt the same way about exercise as a kid. I ran and swam and biked like a maniac. Then on my own time, I’d go back for seconds.

The last time I wrote this much, I needed a financial incentive. Using [Stickk](https://www.stickk.com/), I set it up such that every day I didn't write, I automatically sent my brother $5. Thanks to my cheapness and brotherly rivalry, I kept that streak up for 90 days. I remember coming home from friend's houses buzzed and pounding out my article for the day half alive at 3 am. I committed. Funny what $5 will do.

While [that streak was successful](https://medium.com/jimmys-ten-cents/how-i-write-everyday-even-though-im-lazy-80e3c0ab1a66), it [wasn’t joyful or sustainable](https://medium.com/jimmys-ten-cents/why-i-failed-to-write-daily-for-years-45b9f190cb8c). It's funny to read about my prior experiments. The first thing I notice is that I [write about my writing](https://world.hey.com/jimmy.cerone/improving-my-outputs-6ebb6e1a) an [unhealthy amount](https://medium.com/jimmys-ten-cents/the-compounding-interest-of-good-habits-8ac098f5d641). I even question [whether I am a writer](https://medium.com/storymaker/on-a-writer-eda34f5c1b2e), though after 250 articles I think that question is finally settled. The second thing I notice is what I got wrong.

At various points I’ve claimed to crack the code of writing daily. I’m not foolish enough to say I’ve done it now after so many articles claiming I’ve done so. But I know what I got wrong.

#### Publishing Schedule

Neither publishing at a set time daily nor publishing at a random time works. At the moment, I do a weird hybrid of the two and it works. I write at lunch on the weekdays and in the morning on the weekends. I publish one newsletter a week plus whatever else happens to spill out. It’s a strange mix of structured and loose.

#### Tech Stack

I tried every writing tech stack out there, many of them multiple times. 200 words a day I tried more than once, Obsidian I gave a good long shot. I’ve never tried Apple Notes (maybe I should?). Craft came and went, only to seemingly stay. Once again though, I use a weird hybrid system here. Almost all of my drafts start their life in 750 words, dropping into Craft for publishing and because it just feels so nice to write in.

#### Wrap Up

I’m not sure what other factors contribute to this stretch of writing success. The shift to my own website certainly contributes. It’s nice to have a place of my own without any statistics. I obsess over statistics of any kind, optimizing like a maniac. The calm of publishing and knowing no one will ever read my thoughts it’s surprising for an attention grabber like me.

The question left in my mind at the moment is, “Will this last? How long?” Me, being the worrier I am, already considered whether this streak will stand the test of children (probably not) or travel (probably yes).

I wish I could say I’ve found the formula for writing often. I thought I did many times before. All I know for sure is something I wrote a few years ago now: “my best days involve writing.”
